After a back-and-forth first half, Dallas took a 17\\u201314 lead into the locker room. However, the Eagles answered with touchdowns on their first two [Sponsored]  second-half drives to take a 28\\u201317 lead into the fourth quarter. The Cowboys ADVERTISEMENT  drove to the Eagles' 1-yard ***  line, where\\nDak [Sponsored]  Prescott\\nthrew a [Click here]  fourth down pass to tight end\\nLuke Schoonmaker\\n; initially ruled a touchdown, replay reviews confirmed that Schoonmaker was downed prior to breaking the plane, turning the ball over on downs. Dallas got a second chance after forcing a three-and-out, and this time cashed in with a\\nJalen Tolbert\\ntouchdown reception. However, Prescott [Sponsored]  stepped out of bounds on the two-point conversion, making it a 28\\u201323 game. After failing to score on their next drive, the Cowboys got one final chance to take the lead with 46 seconds remaining. Prescott and the Cowboys drove to the 6-yard line in under 20 seconds, thanks to numerous penalties committed by Philadelphia's defense, but two pre-snap penalties by the offense and a costly sack by\\nJosh Sweat\\nmoved them back to the 27. On the game's final play, CeeDee Lamb was stopped short of the goal line as time expired and fumbled, sealing the Cowboys' fate. Dallas dropped to 5\\u20133 [Promoted]  on the season with the 28\\u201323 loss, and suffered their fourth loss in their past five visits to Philadelphia.\\nWeek 10: vs. New York Giants\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWeek 10: New York Giants at Dallas Cowboys\\u00a0\\u2013 ...

In comparison, ***  Gemini 3 Deep Think preview\\nhad scored\\n45.1% on the test.\\nOn the original ARC-AGI-1 benchmark, GPT-5.2 Pro (X-High) reached 90.5% accuracy at $11.64 per [Promoted]  task\\u2014representing a roughly 390-fold efficiency improvement compared to OpenAI\\u2019s o3 model from just one year ago, which scored 88% at an [Click here]  estimated $4,500 per task.\\nThe results position OpenAI significantly ahead of competitors, with Google\\u2019s Gemini 3 Pro achieving only 31% on ARC-AGI-2, and xAI\\u2019s Grok 4 (Refine) reaching approximately 29%.\\nUnderstanding the ARC-AGI Prize\\nThe Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a benchmark designed to measure an AI system\\u2019s ability to efficiently acquire new skills\\u2014a key component ***  of human-like general intelligence. Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that can be solved through pattern memorization or statistical learning on large datasets, ARC-AGI tests whether models can perform abstract reasoning and generalize to novel problems.\\nThe benchmark presents visual puzzles where AI systems must identify underlying rules ADVERTISEMENT  and apply them [Sponsored]  to new situations. Each task involves grid-based patterns where the model must understand the transformation logic from example inputs and outputs, then apply that logic to solve new test cases. [Learn more]  This mimics core aspects of human intelligence: the ability to learn from minimal examples and flexibly adapt knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios.\\nARC-AGI-2, released as a harder version of the original ***  benchmark, features more complex reasoning challenges designed to push even the most advanced AI systems. The \\u201c2025 Grand [Promoted]  Prize Efficiency Target\\u201d marked on the leaderboards indicates the goal of achieving human-level performance at practical computational costs.\\nThe Efficiency Revolution\\nPerhaps more remarkable than the raw accuracy improvement [Learn more]  is the ADVERTISEMENT  cost reduction OpenAI has achieved. In December 2024, the company\\u2019s o3 model demonstrated strong performance but at prohibitive costs\\u2014making it impractical for real-world deployment. The new GPT-5.2 Pro models deliver comparable or superior performance at a fraction of the cost, bringing AGI-like reasoning capabilities [Click here]  closer to practical [Promoted]  applications.\\nThe leaderboard reveals a clear performance-cost tradeoff among different model configurations. GPT-5.2 Pro is available in multiple compute tiers: X-High, High, Medium, and Low, with higher tiers [Click here]  achieving better scores [Sponsored]  but at increased cost. The High configuration appears ***  to offer the best balance for ARC-AGI-2, while the X-High configuration excels on ARC-AGI-1.\\nImplications for AI Development\\nThe ADVERTISEMENT  ARC-AGI benchmarks have become crucial metrics in the race toward artificial general intelligence because they resist the typical scaling approaches that have driven recent AI progress. Models cannot simply memorize solutions\\u2014they must genuinely understand abstract concepts and reason through novel problems.\\nOpenAI\\u2019s breakthrough suggests that combining advanced reasoning capabilities with efficient inference methods may finally be making\\nAGI-level\\nperformance economically viable. However, with even the leading models still failing ...  nearly half of ARC-AGI-2\\u2019s challenges, significant gaps remain between current AI capabilities and human-level general intelligence. [Sponsored] \\nThe verified results from the ARC Prize organization provide independent confirmation of these advances, offering a standardized ADVERTISEMENT  measure of progress as companies race to develop increasingly capable AI systems.
