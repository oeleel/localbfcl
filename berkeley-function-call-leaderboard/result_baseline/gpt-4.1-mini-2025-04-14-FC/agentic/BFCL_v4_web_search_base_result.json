As a distinguished global academic institution, Yonsei has made significant contributions to society and humanity. Inheriting this prestigious tradition, we aim to advance into a new era of Yonsei, thereby opening the gateway to the future with what makes us uniquely YONSEI.\\nIn the age of \\u201cBig Blur,\\\" we are experiencing the collapse of boundaries between academia and industry. We are confronted with the dual challenges of digital transformation and energy transition on the fiercely competitive battlefield of innovation. Words like creativity, consilience, and convergence have long since become keywords in our society. Innovation is the only way to stay relevant in this rapidly changing international environment.\\nYonsei's enduring mission for 139 years has been to nurture talents who drive innovation and change. We will continue to build on this foundation, to cultivate individuals who proactively tackle the problems of global society while pursuing the values of coexistence. We will strengthen programs that foster creative future talent, such as the \\u201cStudent-Designed Semester,\\u201d enabling students to freely explore academia, to grow as independent agents of the future society.\\nYonsei\\u2019s key asset is the optimal campus in which we can navigate diverse academic disciplines. We aim to bring together Yonsei\\u2019s academic capabilities to address: the meaning and quality of a healthy life in an aging society; redefine human dignity and ethics in the era of artificial intelligence; implement ecological practices to confront climate crises; and consolidate efforts to solve international conflicts and societal challenges. This interdisciplinary research initiative is rooted in a humanistic understanding of humanity and nature embedded in Yonsei spirit. With a focus on future sustainability, including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy, Yonsei will seek to elevate our global research competitiveness.\\nThe new Yonsei era will be realized through \\\"Empowering Yonsei,\\\" founded on the principles of \\\"governance centered on respect and communication.\\\" Enhancing the pride of the Yonsei community through the autonomous and responsible operation of each unit is the first step towards being Yonsei. Ensuring a happy campus, where all Yonseians can pursue studies, research, and personal growth to their hearts\\u2019 content, will indeed be the shortcut for Yonsei to leap forward into a future beyond boundaries.

The verdict?\\nLuxury tea is part flavour, part story, and part bragging rights\\n. If you crave\\ndepth, heritage, and a talking point at dinner\\n, splurge on a gram or two. If you just want a cracking good cup, plenty of mid-range gems deliver\\n90 % of the joy for 5 % of the price\\n.\\nWhatever you choose,\\nbrew with curiosity, sip with gratitude\\n, and remember:\\nthe best tea is the one that makes you pause, smile, and refill the kettle\\n.\\n\\ud83c\\udfc1 Conclusion: Why These Teas Are Worth Every Penny\\nAfter our deep dive into the world of ultra-premium teas\\u2014from the legendary\\nDa Hong Pao\\nmother trees to the quirky but fascinating\\nPanda Dung Tea\\n\\u2014one thing is crystal clear:\\nluxury tea is a blend of heritage, rarity, craftsmanship, and sometimes, a dash of audacity.\\nPositives:\\nThese teas offer\\nunparalleled flavor complexity\\nand aroma profiles that can transform a simple cup into a transcendent experience.\\nMany come with\\nrich stories and cultural significance\\n, connecting you to centuries-old traditions and rare terroirs.\\nSome, like aged Wuyi oolongs and pu-erhs, have\\ninvestment potential\\n, appreciating in value over time.\\nBrands like\\nTWG Tea\\nelevate tea-drinking into an art form, combining exquisite blends with elegant packaging.\\nNegatives:\\nThe price tags can be\\nstaggering\\n, often putting these teas out of reach for casual drinkers.\\nAuthenticity is a challenge\\n; the market is rife with counterfeit luxury teas, so buyers must be vigilant.\\nSome luxury teas, such as gold-flaked varieties, offer\\nmore spectacle than health benefits\\n.\\nBrewing these teas requires\\nprecision and patience\\n; misuse can ruin the experience.\\nOur recommendation?\\nIf you\\u2019re a curious connoisseur or collector,\\ninvest in small quantities of authentic, well-sourced teas\\nlike Da Hong Pao or Tieguanyin. For those who want luxury with a modern twist, TWG Tea\\u2019s curated blends offer a reliable gateway. And if you\\u2019re simply after a sublime cup without the sticker shock, explore\\nsingle-origin mid-tier teas\\nthat capture much of the magic at a fraction of the cost.\\nRemember our earlier question:\\nIs splurging on a few grams of 1980s Narcissus worth it?\\nFor us, yes\\u2014it\\u2019s about the story, the ritual, and the rare pleasure of tasting history.

These teas are prized for their\\nlimited harvests, unique terroirs, and traditional processing methods\\n. Da Hong Pao, for example, comes from a handful of ancient mother bushes in China\\u2019s Wuyi Mountains, making it nearly impossible to mass-produce. Similarly, Gyokuro is shade-grown for weeks, requiring meticulous care. The rarity and craftsmanship elevate these teas to luxury status.\\nHow does the price of premium tea compare to other luxury beverages?\\nWhile fine wines and rare whiskies often steal the spotlight, some teas rival or exceed their prices on a per-kilogram basis. For instance,\\nDa Hong Pao has sold for over $1 million per kilogram\\n, dwarfing most wines. However, tea is usually consumed in smaller quantities per serving, so the cost per cup can be more accessible. Luxury teas also offer\\nunique cultural and sensory experiences\\nthat differ from alcoholic beverages, making them coveted among collectors and connoisseurs alike.\\nWhat makes certain tea brands so expensive and sought after?\\nSeveral factors drive the high price tags:\\nScarcity:\\nLimited harvests from ancient trees or microclimates.\\nLabor-intensive processing:\\nHand-plucking, artisanal rolling, and slow roasting.\\nHeritage and story:\\nHistorical significance and cultural cachet add intangible value.\\nPackaging and presentation:\\nLuxury tins, gold leaf, or diamond embellishments.\\nSustainability and provenance:\\nCertifications and ethical sourcing can increase desirability.\\nBrands like\\nTWG Tea\\ncapitalize on curation and presentation, blending rare leaves into exclusive collections that appeal to luxury consumers worldwide.\\nWhere can I buy the finest and most exclusive teas globally?\\nAuthentic luxury teas are best sourced from\\nreputable specialty retailers\\nand official brand websites. Trusted platforms include:\\nYunnan Sourcing\\nfor Chinese wild teas and oolongs.\\nIppodo Tea\\nand\\nYunomi\\nfor Japanese greens like Gyokuro.\\nTWG Tea\\nboutiques and online store for curated luxury blends.\\nEtsy\\nfor niche products like Panda Dung Tea (with careful vetting).\\nAmazon\\noffers convenience but requires scrutiny of seller authenticity and product origin.\\nAlways look for\\ncertificates of origin, harvest dates, and batch numbers\\nto ensure authenticity.\\n\\ud83d\\udd17 Reference Links and Sources for Further Reading\\nJagran Josh \\u2013 List of the Top Most Expensive Teas in the World\\nRed Rock Tea House \\u2013 Discover the World of Tea Luxury Brands\\nTWG Tea | Luxury Teas & Accessories Online\\nWuyi Protected Designation of Origin Committee\\nIppodo Tea Co., Kyoto\\nYunnan Sourcing \\u2013 Premium Chinese Teas\\nChina Tea Index 2023\\nFor more expert insights and curated tea experiences, explore our\\nTea Brand Spotlights\\nand\\nTea Brand Guides\\n.\\nJacob\\nArticles:\\u00a0292\\nPrevious\\nPost\\nDo Biodegradable Tea Bags Really Boost Flavor & Save the Planet? \\ud83c\\udf3f (2025)\\nNext\\nPost\\n\\ud83d\\udeab 12 Tea Brands to Stay Away From in 2025: What\\u2019s Brewing in Your Cup?\\nNo results\\nCategories\\nBlack Tea\\n(4)\\nGreen Tea\\n(3)\\nHealth Benefits of Tea\\n(39)\\nHerbal Tea\\n(12)\\nOolong Tea\\n(2)\\nSpecialty Blends\\n(10)\\nTea Accessories\\n(6)\\nTea Brand Guides\\n(66)\\nTea Brand Spotlights\\n(81)\\nTea Brewing Techniques\\n(4)\\nTea Culture and History\\n(19)\\nTea Education and Tips\\n(21)\\nTea Facts\\n(10)\\nTea Gardens and Plantations\\n(2)\\nTea Industry News\\n(14)\\nTea Recipes\\n(3)\\nTea Tasting and Reviews\\n(75)\\nTea Tourism\\n(2)\\nWhite Tea\\n(1)\\nRecent Posts\\n8 Best American Tea Companies Brewing Unique Flavors in 2025 \\ud83c\\udf75\\n15 Popular Tea Brands You Must Try in 2025 \\ud83c\\udf75\\nTop 15 Tea Brands USA You Need to Try in 2025 \\u2615\\ufe0f\\n\\u2615 17 Best Tea Brands to Sip in 2025: Expert Picks & Hidden Gems\\nWhat Is the Most Popular Tea Brand in the US?

The Hang Seng Index rallied almost 20% as officials promised greater economic support, while DeepSeek\\u2019s January release of a highly affordable AI model reignited investor interest in the country\\u2019s technology sector. As a result, the collective fortune of Chinese billionaires on\\nForbes\\n\\u2019 2025 ranking reached $1.68 trillion\\u2013up 26% from $1.33 trillion a year ago and also exceeding 2023\\u2019s total of $1.67 trillion.\\nThat optimism translated to a rising number of billionaires for the country. This year, there are 450 mainland Chinese members of the three-comma club, up from 406 last year but still well short of the 495 reached in 2023. Mainland China accounts for the second-largest number of billionaires globally, behind the U.S., which has 902 billionaires.\\nMainland China doesn\\u2019t include passport holders from Hong Kong or Macau, whom\\nForbes\\nlists separately. One example is\\nLi Ka-shing\\n, Hong Kong\\u2019s richest with $38.9 billion net worth, who has built his business empire under CK Hutchison Holdings and CK Asset Holdings. Counting those billionaires, greater China has 516 members, up from 473 in 2024 but still down from 562 in 2023. In all, there are 3,028 billionaires on the planet, worth a collective $16.1 trillion.\\nWhile 23 from last year\\u2019s list fell off, there are 31 newcomers in mainland China and 37 returnees, or members who made the list in the past, fell off and have now returned to the ranks with a net worth of at least $1 billion. One notable newcomer is DeepSeek founder\\nLiang Wenfeng\\n, who has trained one of the world\\u2019s best-performing AI models at a fraction of the costs spent by rivals including OpenAI. Liang, 40, has an estimated net worth of $1 billion based on his ownership in DeepSeek and hedge fund High-Flyer.\\nThe ten richest Chinese citizens, meanwhile, are worth a collective $400.5 billion, up from $304 billion last year, and higher than the $311 billion reached in 2023. Beverage giant Nongfu Spring chairman\\nZhong Shanshan\\n, who was China\\u2019s richest person for four consecutive years, ceded the prime spot this year to ByteDance founder\\nZhang Yiming\\n. Zhong, now at No. 2, has a net worth of $57.5 billion, down from $62.3 billion in 2024.\\nChina\\u2019s wealthiest person for the first time, Zhang boosted his fortune by more than 50% over the past year, to $65.5 billion. Despite uncertainties over the fate of TikTok in the U.S., privately held ByteDance has seen its valuation increase above $300 billion from $217 billion last year as investors are encouraged by the potential of its AI technology. Its Doubao chatbot app has attracted 82 million monthly active users (MAUs), making it the world\\u2019s second most popular AI chatbot in February after OpenAI\\u2019s ChatGPT, which had 401 million MAUs, according to aicpb.com, a Hunan-based website that tracks AI products globally. DeepSeek\\u2019s chatbot ranked No. 4 with 62 million MAUs.\\nIn total, eight out of the top ten richest billionaires in China have seen their fortunes increase. The wealth of Xiaomi founder\\nLei Jun\\nsoared 300%, to $43.5 billion, as the company\\u2019s electric vehicle venture sees higher demand for its cars. But one Xiaomi vehicle under driver-assistance mode was involved in a deadly crash that happened on a Chinese highway on March 29, which caused the stock to fall as much as 6.1% on Tuesday amid worries this may dent future growth.\\nAlibaba cofounder\\nJack Ma\\nhas seen his net worth increase to $28.6 billion from $24.5 billion in 2024. Ma was among a cohort of Chinese entrepreneurs invited to meet President Xi Jinping this February, when the leader used the rare meeting to strongly signal his support for the private sector.\\nHere are the 10 richest Chinese citizens on the 2025 World\\u2019s Billionaires list\\nNET WORTHS ARE AS OF MARCH 7, 2025\\n#10. Lu Xiangyang\\nSource of Wealth:\\nAutomobiles\\n| Residence:\\nGuangzhou\\n| Net Worth:\\n$20 billion\\n(vs. $11.6 billion)\\nLu Xiangyang teamed up with his cousin Wang Chuanfu to start BYD in 1995. A former employee of the People\\u2019s Bank of China, Lu is now vice chairman of the company, which has grown from an obscure battery maker to the world\\u2019s largest electric vehicle firm by deliveries. Lu, who derives his fortune primarily from a BYD stake, also runs his own investment firm Youngy Investment Holding Group. The Guangzhou-based company\\u2019s assets include stakes in BYD and a lithium mine in the Chinese province of Sichuan, according to its website.\\n#9. Wang Chuanfu\\nSource of Wealth:\\nAutomobiles\\n| Residence:\\nShenzhen\\n| Net Worth:\\n$26.4 billion\\n(vs. $14.2 billion)\\nBYD chairman and CEO Wang Chuanfu led his electric vehicle maker to surpass Elon Musk\\u2019s Tesla in global sales in 2024. The company\\u2019s total revenues surged 29% year-on-year to $107 billion, above Tesla\\u2019s $97.7 billion. BYD, which makes plug-in hybrids as well as pure electric models, shipped 4.27 million cars worldwide. This year, Wang plans to ship 5.5 million vehicles globally as he aims to capture more markets overseas. Chinese auto brands are \\u201cno longer playing catch-up,\\u201d the mogul wrote in the company\\u2019s 2024 annual report. \\u201cWith a bold, trailblazing mindset, the group is leading the charge, partnering with other Chinese brands to expand globally.\\u201d\\n#8. He Xiangjian\\nSource of Wealth:\\nHome appliances\\n| Residence:\\nFoshan\\n| Net Worth:\\n$27 billion\\n(vs.$25.1 billion)\\nHe Xiangjian stepped down as chairman of home appliance giant Midea Group in 2012, but still holds his wealth primarily from a company stake. Midea\\u2019s Shenzhen-listed shares have risen almost 20% over the past 12 months, as China\\u2019s subsidy program for consumer trade-ins is believed to benefit the company. Riding on the momentum, Midea last September raised $4 billion in its upsized Hong Kong share sale. The company intends to use the proceeds for global expansion, upgrading its supply chain and enhancing its distribution network, according to its prospectus.\\n#7. Jack Ma\\nSource of Wealth:\\nE-commerce\\n| Residence:\\nHangzhou\\n| =Net Worth:\\n$28.6 billion\\n(vs. $24.5 billion)\\nAfter keeping a low profile over the past few years, Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma returned to the spotlight in February. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping that month when the government invited him and other business leaders, including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, to a symposium in Beijing. Ma and the others were encouraged to expand and contribute to China\\u2019s economy. The e-commerce behemoth, now led by chairman Joe Tsai and CEO Eddie Wu, has made a series of breakthroughs in AI. Its Qwen series of models have surpassed some of OpenAI\\u2019s in performance, the company says, and its technology has been chosen by Apple to power the American company\\u2019s forthcoming AI services for iPhone users in China. To support its AI endeavors, Alibaba announced this February it will invest $53 billion over the next three years in related infrastructure. Ma stepped down as chairman in 2019 but still holds a stake in the company.\\n#6. William Ding\\nSource of Wealth:\\nOnline games\\n| Residence:\\nHangzhou\\n| Net Worth:\\n$33.3 billion\\n(vs. $33.5 billion)\\nNetEase founder William Ding is trying to resuscitate growth at his gaming giant, as the lack of new titles and cut-throat competition have caused 2024 sales to grow a meager 1.7% year-on-year to $14.4 billion, while net income was essentially flat at $4.1 billion. Ding has reportedly reshuffled the management ranks behind Eggy Party, a casual mobile game that has become one of the company\\u2019s most successful titles since its release in 2022. The company should find renewed growth in the first half of 2025, thanks in part to Marvel Rivals, a shooter game developed in collaboration with Marvel Games and released in December, according to a February research note from Hong Kong-based Blue Lotus Research Institute.\\n#5. Colin Huang\\nSource of Wealth:\\nE-commerce\\n| Residence:\\nShanghai\\n| Net Worth:\\n$42.3 billion\\n(vs. $38.9 billion)\\nPDD Holdings\\u2019 founder Colin Huang moved down two spots to No.5 this year, as the e-commerce behemoth battles stiff competition and faces geopolitical challenges. The headwinds are particularly pronounced in its 2024 fourth quarter results. The Temu parent posted in March a 24% year-on-year rise in revenues to $15.2 billion for the period \\u2013 marking its slowest pace of quarterly expansion in years. As the company hands out consumer coupons and reduces merchant fees amid fierce competition with rivals including Alibaba, its net income grew only 18% year-on-year to $3.8 billion \\u2013 down from the blistering pace of two-fold increases seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. While faster growth in early 2024 still helped full-year sales increase 59% to $54 billion and net income jumped 87% to 15.4 billion, PDD Holdings faces mounting uncertainties in its overseas expansion. Temu, its international arm that acts as a key growth driver, is confronted with the threat of possible changes to a U.S. policy that exempts items worth less than $800 from tariff charges. Temu has grabbed market share from Amazon thanks to dirt cheap goods, such as $8 shoes, that are largely shipped from China.\\n#4. Lei Jun\\nSource of Wealth:\\nSmartphones, automobiles\\n| Residence:\\nBeijing\\n| Net Worth:\\n$43.5 billion\\n(vs. $10.9 billion)\\nLei Jun\\u2019s wealth grew by three-fold to $43.5 billion amid investor optimism over Xiaomi\\u2019s electric vehicle business. Before the March 29 crash, the company chairman and CEO raised Xiaomi\\u2019s 2025 EV delivery target to 350,000 units from 300,000, as demand for its Telsa Model 3 competitor the SU7 sedan\\u2014which has a starting price of 215,900 yuan ($30,000) in China \\u2014 has far outstripped supply. To shorten the waitlist for the car, which can still stretch into eight months, Xiaomi is reportedly expanding the size of a planned second factory in Beijing. Earlier in March, the Hong Kong-listed company raised $5.5 billion in an upsized share sale to fund its business expansion and technology research.\\n#3. Ma Huateng\\nSource of Wealth:\\nOnline games\\n| Residence:\\nShenzhen\\n| Net Worth:\\n$56.2 billion\\n(vs. $30.2 billion)\\nTencent\\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares nearly doubled over the past 12 months amid a broad rally of China\\u2019s technology-related companies. They might have more room for growth, as Ma invests for the future. The Chinese tech giant will spend $1.3 billion for a 25% stake in a newly created entity that hosts some of Ubisoft\\u2019s (a French game maker) most popular assets, including Assassin\\u2019s Creed; Tencent aims to turn the video game franchises into \\u201clong-term evergreen game platforms,\\u201d according to a statement released in March. The company is also bullish on AI as it starts to integrate its proprietary AI technologies into WeChat, providing functions such as AI-powered search to the messaging app\\u2019s nearly 1.4 billion users. Its separate AI app, the Yuanbao digital assistant, can perform more tasks like taking phone calls and generating content summaries.\\n#2. Zhong Shanshan\\nSource of Wealth:\\nBeverages, pharmaceuticals\\n| Residence:\\nHangzhou\\n| Net Worth:\\n$57.7 billion (vs. 62.3 billion)\\nIt has shaped out to be a tough year for Nongfu Spring founder Zhong Shanshan, who was China\\u2019s richest man from 2021 to 2024. In sharp contrast with previous years, when sales grew by double digits, 2024 revenues were essentially flat at $5.9 billion. Net income, which came in at $1.7 billion, barely grew either. The Hong Kong-listed company is feeling the fallout from a public opinion crisis earlier last year, when nationalist consumers vowed to boycott its bottled drinks as they criticized Nongfu Spring for being \\u201cpro-Japan\\u201d because the packaging of certain products supposedly resembled Japanese architecture. And as the company launched purified water products that sell for less than $0.14 per bottle to attract frugal shoppers, earnings took its own hit as well.\\n#1.\\tZhang Yiming\\nSource of Wealth:\\nInternet media\\n| Residence:\\nSingapore\\n| Net Worth:\\n$65.5 billion\\n(vs. $43.4 billion)\\nAlthough TikTok\\u2019s fate still hangs in the balance in the U.S.\\u2014 where it faces an April 5 deadline to be sold or banned \\u2014 parent ByteDance is seeing its valuation increase to $312 billion in private markets. This is partly due to the AI craze, as investors bet the next breakthrough may still come from China, after DeepSeek in January released a highly affordable model that shocked Silicon Valley. Zhang stepped down as ByteDance chairman in 2021 but still plays a key role in the company\\u2019s AI strategy that ranges from capital expenditure to hiring. The reclusive mogul wants artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI to match or surpass human intelligence, according to state-affiliated news outlet The Paper.\\nMore From Forbes\\nForbes\\nHow Truth Social And Crypto Helped Trump Double His Fortune In Just One Year\\nBy\\nDan Alexander\\nForbes\\nAI Boom Billionaires: These Tech Moguls Joined The Forbes List In 2025\\nBy\\nPhoebe Liu\\nForbes\\nThe World\\u2019s Richest Person 2025\\nBy\\nJohn Hyatt\\nForbes\\nThe Richest Women In The World 2025\\nBy\\nJulie Goldenberg\\nForbes\\nThe World\\u2019s Richest Woman 2025\\nBy\\nJulie Goldenberg\\nEditorial Standards\\nReprints & Permissions\\n\\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Each of our locations support local charities and we offer the opportunity to participate in international mission trips.\\nWhat do these mean for Lineage?\\nAs a company and as individuals, we strive to personify and apply these core values in all of our daily behaviors, actions, and interactions. In every one of our offices, our purpose and values are widely displayed to remind our team members to lean into them.\\nOur leaders act with these values in mind when making internal business decisions. When working externally and making connections outside of our offices, we stand tall with these values leading us forward. All of our team members are expected to adhere to them in the efforts that they make.\\nAt Lineage, we take our purpose, mission, and core values seriously in our culture. We don\\u2019t let them pass us by like tossed papers flowing through the wind. Rather, we commit ourselves to them in every aspect of our business because it\\u2019s by abiding by these that we can successfully come through for our customers.\\nYes, we come through for our customers. We come through for each other. Neither rain nor snow nor gloom of night, nor a heavy workload, nor even a really, really bad cold will stop us from the swift completion of our mission. We come through. Because for Lineage, the important things never change.\\nA Faith-Based Organization\\nSince stepping into ownership of the company, Richard has only wanted to bring out the best in his team. And, in kind, that his teams offer their best back. If his team is at its best, then service to clients will be at its best.\\nHow does Richard do this? By creating a \\u201ccaring culture\\u201d developed by roots in his faith.\\nHe uses this conviction, as well as significant collaboration with company leaders, to create a culture that cares in more ways than one.\\nThis culture of caring at Lineage is one where the company generously gives to and invests in its employees to the point where they never question that they\\u2019re cared for. It\\u2019s a culture where the people involved genuinely care about each other. Care about each others\\u2019 success. Care about each others\\u2019 wellbeing. Care about each others\\u2019 growth and stability.\\nRead more about how we do this with our Caring Team below.\\nThis is why many of Lineage\\u2019s employees have decades of tenure with the company and why over a thousand of Lineage\\u2019s customers have worked with the company for over 10 years. It\\u2019s also what helps Lineage\\u2019s customer service be as excellent as it is.\\nRichard firmly believes team members who feel like they're a part of our company family will treat clients like they\\u2019re also a part of that same family. This is why we embed a \\u201cfamily culture\\u201d value alongside our caring culture. It\\u2019s also why they have been and will continue to be an integral part of the Lineage culture.\\nOur purpose states, \\\"Honor God by serving, supporting, and caring with excellence.\\\" You don't have to be religious to work at Lineage. All we ask is that you align with the rest of the purpose to serve, support, and care with excellence. We are an equal-opportunity employer and respect all people, viewpoints, and backgrounds.\\nOur Clients\\nWhile Lineage has seen exponential growth, we\\u2019ve never changed how we treat our clients.\\nPerson-to-electronic communication isn\\u2019t personal and, as we all know, is a pain to deal with.\\nThis is why Lineage dedicates itself to making all client interactions be with real people and in-house employees.  Our customers pay top-dollar for our services, so they deserve top-dollar customer service too.\\nWhen it comes to our clients, we treat every single one with\\nintegrity\\n. We don\\u2019t sell them what they don\\u2019t need, obscure the truth, or treat them like a number. We treat them like honest people, and all people deserve fair treatment.\\nOur Caring Team\\n\\u201cIf our employee takes care of their W2, then we\\u2019ll take care of their future.\\u201d\\nThat line has just as much meaning today as when Richard\\u2019s father said it the first time. From profit sharing to company events to the Caring Team, Lineage invests in its team members.\\nWhat is the Caring Team?\\nIn any business, team members face personal issues and roadblocks that they can\\u2019t get around. This often leads to unintended, accidental, or unfair loss of employment.\\nRichard hates this idea and that many businesses have this philosophy with their employees. This, as well as our overarching caring culture, is why Richard and company leadership started the Caring Team at Lineage.\\nEach office has its own dedicated team, made up of volunteer representatives within the company, that operate as a communication conduit, initiate employee care, and manage volunteer efforts.Team members can contact their respective Caring Team leader when they need financial assistance so they don\\u2019t have to sacrifice work or  care for their families. It could be a gift of money, a loan, or counseling.\\nLineage takes care of our clients and our team members because, to us, you are family.\\nReach Out To Us Today\\nFind out more about what\\u2019s going on in the industries we work with, what working with us is like, and about how we can help you improve your business:\\nBook a strategy session\\nDiscover how Lineage can help optimize your communication workflow with a free, no-obligation analysis.\\nNext\\nShop for supplies\\nGet the supplies you need quickly with same-day shipping, and be back up and running in no time.\\nNext\\nPlace a service call\\nMachine down?

4, 2025, 1:39:00 PM\\nBy Philip van Doorn\\nA strategy of selecting stocks based on rapid revenue growth has outperformed the broad market over the decades\\nMarketWatch's Brett Arends covered research showing that a combination of looking back at companies' increases in sales and earnings, along with spending on research and development, led to significant outperformance when compared with the broad stock market over a period of more than 54 years.\\nArends interviewed Rob Arnott, founder and chair of Research Affiliates, who explained that a strategy of stock selection and portfolio management focused on the abovementioned factors, with portfolios updated annually, had outperformed a broad market index by wide margins over the decades.\\nThe above article includes links to the detailed research results. While the ideal process Arnott cited would involve several factors, the reports included average total return information for the individual factors. For example, a portfolio selected based only on the highest rolling five-year increases in sales per share had an average annual return of 12.2% from March 1969 through December 2024, while a broad index of the \\\"top 1,000 firms by market capitalization\\\" would have had an average annual return of 10.6%.\\nSo we decided to apply this simple screen to the S&P 500 SPX.\\nThe Research Affiliates report specifically cited sales per share, so we looked back at the companies' past six full fiscal years to show five-year growth rates for sales per share. Then for additional information that might be of use to readers researching individual stocks, we looked ahead at projected sales-per-share growth rates for the current and following two fiscal years.\\nHere are the 20 stocks in the S&P showing the highest compound annual growth rates  for sales or revenue per share  over the past five full fiscal years:\\nCompany                             Ticker   Five-year SPS CAGR \\n   Moderna Inc.

What we have above is a snapshot based on the companies' sales per share over the past five full fiscal years.\\nSo let's look ahead using consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet to see what type of sales growth pace may be in store for these companies.\\nLeaving the group in the same order, here are projected SPS CAGR from the most recent completed fiscal year, market year zero, through the next three fiscal years.

The New SOTA ARC-AGI-2 benchmark!\\nReport this article\\nSteve Nouri\\nSteve Nouri\\nPublished Dec 8, 2025\\n+ Follow\\nPoetiq just broke the state-of-the-art on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, becoming the first model to pass 50% accuracy, officially verified by the ARC Prize team.\\nWith 54% accuracy and a cost of just $30.57 per problem, Poetiq\\u2019s approach is not only smarter but significantly more efficient less than half the cost of previous leaders.\\nThe model now holds the #1 spot on the ARC-AGI-2 leaderboard.\\nThe real drag on AI isn\\u2019t the model. It\\u2019s everything around it.\\nI rarely see AI projects fail because the model is weak. They fail in the plumbing around it. Data pipelines, connectors and environment drift create the most drag.\\nThat is why our team tested Sinapsis. We could sketch a workflow visually, then switch to the Python API without rebuilding anything. That continuity is where so many tools fall apart.\\nFor those of you who have pushed AI into production, which part of the integration stack slows you down the most?\\nSee why Sinapsis was built specifically to eliminate that friction\\nChina and USA dominated the AI papers at NeurIPS 2025!\\nNeurIPS 2025 delivered breakthroughs across scaling, reasoning, RL, memory architectures, self-supervision, diffusion, and biological modeling. Below is our curated list of the 15 papers worth your time plus\\nwhy each one actually matters\\nfor the future of AI.\\n\\ud83c\\udfc6 Award-Winning & Foundational Papers\\n1. Faster R-CNN (Test of Time Award)\\nIntroduced Region Proposal Networks and popularized end-to-end trainable object detection.\\nWhy it matters:\\nThis architecture set the foundation for a decade of breakthroughs in vision, powering early autonomous driving, detection systems, and research benchmarks. Its recognition today shows how crucial architectural simplicity + shared computation still are.\\n2.\\nArtificial Hivemind: The Open-Ended Homogeneity of LMs\\nShows that LLMs tend to converge toward similar answers a phenomenon of diversity collapse.\\nWhy it matters:\\nAs AI becomes widely deployed, homogeneity can create systemic risks, reduce creativity, and amplify cultural bias. Understanding hivemind behavior is essential for safety, personalization, and model diversity.\\n3.\\nOptimal Mistake Bounds for Transductive Online Learning\\nSettles a 30-year question around the value of unlabeled data in online learning.\\nWhy it matters:\\nProvides mathematically tight guarantees that guide the next generation of semi-supervised and active learning systems. This could reduce training cost dramatically for enterprise and low-data domains.\\n4.\\nGated Attention for LLMs\\nAdds a simple sigmoid gate after SDPA to boost performance and long-context stability.\\nWhy it matters:\\nOffers a lightweight alternative to complex attention rewrites like MHA variants or RoPE hacks. If widely adopted, it could meaningfully extend context windows and improve reliability with minimal compute overhead.\\nThe moment you encounter a dataset with no clue about its creator or purpose, the underlying issue becomes clear: enterprise data is frequently passed down without context, full of inconsistencies, and guided by undocumented rules.\\nI\\u2019ve been testing Sema4.ai\\u2019s DataFrames on the kind of datasets that usually take hours just to stabilize. What stood out was how quickly it moved from a natural-language question to something I could use. It generated SQL that made sense, and everything ran locally.\\nThe lightbulb moment was when I joined a few million rows from sources I usually ignore because the effort is too much. This time it ran cleanly without writing code, and the results fed directly into the agent workflows I was building.\\nIt felt like a tool designed for how chaotic real data work can be.\\nIf you\\u2019re dealing with scattered or half-documented data, this is worth exploring.\\n\\u2705 Sema4.ai/DataFrames\\n\\ud83d\\udd2c Scaling, Dynamics & Deep Insights\\n5.\\nSuperposition Yields Robust Neural Scaling\\nShows that scaling laws naturally emerge from strong superposition.\\nWhy it matters:\\nHelps explain\\nwhen\\nscaling works and\\nwhy\\nit sometimes breaks unpredictably. This insight can save millions in training budgets by predicting when additional parameters or tokens won\\u2019t yield returns.\\n6.\\nWhy Diffusion Models Don\\u2019t Memorize\\nReveals two phases of diffusion training: generalization \\u2192 memorization.\\nWhy it matters:\\nOffers a principled explanation for why diffusion models avoid overfitting longer than GANs. This could make synthetic data generation safer for private datasets.\\n7.\\nDoes RL Really Incentivize Reasoning in LLMs?\\nFinds RL improves efficiency but rarely creates\\nnew\\nreasoning patterns beyond the base model.\\nWhy it matters:\\nChallenges the hype around \\u201cRL-makes-models-smart.\\u201d Suggests future reasoning improvements may require architectural changes, richer objectives, or multimodal grounding.\\n8.\\n1000-Layer Networks for Self-Supervised RL\\nDemonstrates huge capability gains by scaling depth alone in RL.\\nWhy it matters:\\nSuggests that RL may follow a scaling law trajectory similar to LLMs. Could unlock general-purpose agents that learn complex behaviors without reward engineering.\\n\\ud83e\\udde9 Memory, Architecture & Long-Term Reasoning\\n9\\n. Titans + MIRAS (Google Research)\\nA long-term memory system with a deep MLP that updates itself using \\u201csurprise signals.\\u201d\\nWhy it matters:\\nAddresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in AI today, persistent memory across million-token contexts. This could reshape agents, copilots, and any workload requiring continuity over days/weeks.\\n\\ud83c\\udfa8 Generation, Synthetic Data & Evaluation\\n10.\\nGenerative Data Augmentation (DAR-GDA)\\nA one-step distilled diffusion generator with adversarial alignment and importance reweighting.\\nWhy it matters:\\nEnables high-quality synthetic datasets with much lower compute. Critical for training in domains where real data is scarce, biased, or expensive (e.g., medical, robotics, simulation).\\n11.\\nEvaluating Multiple Models Using Labeled & Unlabeled Data (SSME)\\nA semi-supervised evaluation method modeling prediction\\u2013label relationships.\\nWhy it matters:\\nEvaluation is becoming the new bottleneck in AI. This method makes accurate offline model comparison possible even with limited labels, cheaper, faster, and more robust.\\n\\ud83e\\udde0 Theory, Chaos & Geometric Models\\n12.\\nSlow Transition to Low-Dimensional Chaos in Heavy-Tailed RNNs\\nShows heavy-tailed RNNs behave in fundamentally different ways from Gaussian ones.\\nWhy it matters:\\nProvides clues for designing more brain-like, stable, energy-efficient models. Also helps explain emergent structure and long-range dependencies in real neural systems.\\n13.\\nRiemannian Consistency Model\\nA generalization of consistency models to curved manifolds.\\nWhy it matters:\\nUnlocks generation on non-Euclidean spaces, a big deal for robotics, protein folding, 3D geometry, and rotations. It expands generative modeling beyond the flat world of pixels and vectors.\\n\\ud83e\\uddec Biology, Multimodal Reasoning & Molecular AI\\n14.\\nBioReason\\nConnects a DNA-model backbone with an LLM for multimodal biological reasoning.\\nWhy it matters:\\nPushes AI deeper into interpretable genomics, an increasingly critical field. Could accelerate target discovery, diagnostics, and drug reasoning workflows.\\n\\ud83d\\udef0\\ufe0f Robotics, SLAM & Dynamic Environments\\n15.\\nNFL-BA: Near-Field Light Bundle Adjustment for SLAM\\nModels near-field lighting correctly for SLAM in dynamic or reflective environments.\\nWhy it matters:\\nTraditional SLAM fails under complex lighting, exactly the conditions found in endoscopy, low-light robotics, and AR. This closes a key gap toward robust real-world autonomous systems.\\nAI Frontier\\nAI Frontier\\n855,429 followers\\n+ Subscribe\\nLike\\nComment\\nCopy\\nLinkedIn\\nFacebook\\nX\\nShare\\n263\\n7 Comments\\nPramuka Weerasinghe\\n5d\\nReport this comment\\nGreat insights of some brilliant research\\nLike\\nReply\\n1\\u00a0Reaction\\nHr Dr. Takahisa Karita\\nTop Entrepreneurs Setting New Standards in Their Industry in 2025 by USA Today.

Stay tuned.\\nWe play well with others. Our system can be used to optimize AI components inside existing,\\n                            larger systems. Look for this in the near future.\\nCan we solve long horizon tasks by leveraging the wealth of world knowledge already\\n                            present in frontier models without resorting to updating the models themselves? If we can\\n                            transform the underlying knowledge extraction mechanisms to be just a bit more LLM friendly,\\n                            maybe we can get away with no model tuning at all.

The New York May auctions, despite a nerve-racking cyberattack that brought down Christie\\u2019s website for several days, managed to sell nearly $1.4 billion worth of art. This was followed by a tepid series of London sales in June and the tentpole November auctions in New York, which reflected a persistently cautious mood: Sotheby\\u2019s, Christie\\u2019s, and Phillips collectively sold $1.3 billion worth of art\\u2014down 40% from last November, according to the\\nNew York Times\\n.\\nAnother theme of the year was the reemergence of the Hong Kong market, which claims three of the year\\u2019s top 10 most expensive sales.

The painting\\u2014hailed as the \\u201ccrown jewel\\u201d of American interior designer Mica Ertegun\\u2019s collection by the auction house\\u2014shattered the artist\\u2019s auction record, previously set at Sotheby\\u2019s London in 2022 for\\nL\\u2019empire des lumi\\u00e8res\\n(1961), which sold for \\u00a359.42 million ($79.24 million).\\nMeasuring approximately 5 by 4 feet, this painting is one of the largest works in Magritte\\u2019s famed \\u201cEmpire of Light\\u201d series, which comprises 27 variations on the surreal theme of juxtaposed day and night imagery. The serene scene features a house lit by a single streetlamp, its warm yellow glow reflected in a body of water below, while the sky above remains a daytime blue scattered with clouds. Slightly shrouded by silhouetted trees, the painting evokes a dreamlike contrast between light and shadow, day and night.\\nAnother version of the Belgian artist\\u2019s \\u201cEmpire of Light\\u201d series gained attention when it was showcased in the Belgian pavilion at the 1954 Venice Biennale before joining Peggy Guggenheim\\u2019s collection. Magritte subsequently expanded the theme into a series over the following 15 years to satisfy demand from eager collectors.\\nEd Ruscha\\n,\\nStandard Station, Ten-Cent Western Being Torn in Half\\n, 1964\\n$68,260,000\\nEd Ruscha,\\nStandard Station, Ten-Cent Western Being Torn in Half,\\n1964. Courtesy of Christie\\u2019s.\\nEd Ruscha\\n\\u2019s\\nStandard Station, Ten-Cent Western Being Torn in Half\\n(1964) broke the artist\\u2019s auction record when it sold for $68.26 million at\\nChristie\\u2019s New York in November\\n. The work, which smashed its $50 million estimate, was originally acquired by Texas-based oil heir Sid R. Bass in 1976 through a trade involving another piece from the same series.\\nStandard Station, Ten-Cent Western Being Torn in Half\\nis the last of the large-scale paintings by Ruscha from the 1960s to be held privately. This grouping of works are celebrated for their incorporation of textual elements within minimalist landscapes.\\nThe painting features a Standard Oil gas station along Route 66 in Amarillo, Texas. In the right-hand corner, there is a torn dime-store novel emblematic of Ruscha\\u2019s commentary on American consumerism and nostalgia. The artist discovered this particular station, which was featured in several other paintings, during his road trip from Los Angeles to visit his family in Oklahoma City. Its significance was amplified by its recent inclusion in Ruscha\\u2019s retrospective \\u201cEd Ruscha / Now Then,\\u201d exhibited at the\\nMuseum of Modern Art\\nand the\\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art\\nin 2023\\u201324.\\nThe sale eclipsed Ruscha\\u2019s previous record of $52.5 million, set in 2019 at Christie\\u2019s with\\nHurting the Word Radio #2\\n(1964).\\nClaude Monet\\n,\\nNymph\\u00e9as\\n, 1914\\u201317\\n$65,500,000\\nClaude Monet,\\nNymph\\u00e9as\\n, 1914\\u201317.

This monumental painting, part of the French\\nImpressionist\\n\\u2019s renowned \\u201cWater Lilies\\u201d series, is a rare\\nen plein air\\nwork from Monet\\u2019s Giverny garden, where he found endless inspiration in his lily pond.\\nThe painting, measuring approximately 5 by 6.5 feet, showcases the lush, light-dappled aesthetics for which Monet is renowned and stands as one of the earliest iterations of his iconic \\u201cWater Lilies\\u201d series, comprising approximately 250 oil paintings. Departing from the more realistic depictions of the water lily pond seen in his earlier works, Monet\\u2019s focus in this piece shifts entirely to the water\\u2019s surface, capturing its reflections and interplay of light and color.\\nAnother earlier work from this series,\\nNymph\\u00e9as\\n(1897\\u201399),\\nmade its auction debut at Christie\\u2019s Hong Kong\\nin August, selling for HK$233.3 million (US$29.9 million) and setting a new auction record for a work by the artist in Asia.\\nJ\\nean-Michel Basquiat\\n,\\nUntitled (ELMAR)\\n, 1982\\n$46,479,000\\nJean-Michel Basquiat,\\nUntitled (ELMAR)\\n, 1982.

Originally acquired in 1984 by Italian anthropologist Francesco Pellizzi from Basquiat\\u2019s first dealer, Annina Nosei, the work remained in Pellizzi\\u2019s private collection for four decades.\\nUntitled (ELMAR)\\nboasts a notable exhibition history, having been featured in a 1998 show commemorating the 10th anniversary of the artist\\u2019s death at\\nGagosian\\nin Los Angeles, and in the artist\\u2019s retrospective at Paris\\u2019s Fondation Louis Vuitton in 2018. Basquiat\\u2019s auction record is held by\\nUntitled (1982\\n), which sold at Sotheby\\u2019s for $110.5 million in 2017.\\nRen\\u00e9 Magritte,\\nL\\u2019ami intime\\n, 1958\\n$42,123,969\\nMaking its auction return after 44 years, Ren\\u00e9 Magritte\\u2019s\\nL\\u2019ami intime\\n(1958) sold for $42.12 million in March at a standalone Surrealism sale held by Christie\\u2019s in London. The painting is one of the few examples of Magritte\\u2019s portraits of his signature bowler-hatted man that remains in private hands. This work depicts the back of the bowler-hatted man with a baguette and a wine glass floating behind him.\\nAccording to Christie\\u2019s, the last time the painting came to auction was in 1980, when it sold at Sotheby\\u2019s London for \\u00a390,000 ($207,000) to French dealer Georges Marci. Shortly after, the work was acquired by prominent collectors Gilbert and Lena Kaplan and was rarely seen in public. The last time the painting was exhibited was at Brussels\\u2019s Mus\\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique in 1998.\\nAndy Warhol\\n,\\nFlowers\\n, 1964\\n$35,485,000\\nAndy Warhol,\\nFlowers\\n, 1964. Courtesy of Christie\\u2019s.\\nThe enduring appeal of\\nAndy Warhol\\n\\u2019s iconic \\u201cFlowers\\u201d series was reaffirmed when\\nFlowers\\n(1964) sold for $35.48 million at\\nChristie\\u2019s 20th-century evening sale in May\\n. Measuring nearly 7 feet on each side, the painting\\u2014made with acrylic, fluorescent paint, and silkscreen ink on linen\\u2014surpassed its high estimate of $30 million after approximately five minutes of bidding.\\nWarhol created his \\u201cFlowers\\u201d series in response to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1964, juxtaposing vibrant floral imagery with the somber realities of mortality. This particular work made its auction debut, having been originally sold through Leo Castelli Gallery in New York to the collector Frederick R. Weisman. The piece features hand-painted petals and boasts a notable provenance, including ownership by Search Investment Ltd. in London, which acquired it from Thomas Ammann Fine Art in Z\\u00fcrich before the 1990s.\\nHighlighting the increasing demand for Warhol\\u2019s \\u201cFlowers,\\u201d this sale achieved more than double that of another work from the same series, which sold for $15.8 million at Christie\\u2019s in 2022. At that same auction, mega-dealer Larry Gagosian purchased\\nShot Sage Blue Marilyn\\n(1964) for $195 million\\u2014setting Warhol\\u2019s auction record and making it the most expensive artwork by an American artist ever sold under the hammer.\\nClaude Monet\\n,\\nMeules \\u00e0 Giverny\\n, 1893\\n$34,804,500\\nClaude Monet,\\nMeules \\u00e0 Giverny,\\n1893.

The artwork was first brought to the United States by the American landscape painter\\nDwight Blaney\\nin 1895, where it was lent to the\\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston\\n.\\nMeules \\u00e0 Giverny\\nis among the last works in Monet\\u2019s \\u201cHaystacks\\u201d series of approximately 25 paintings, each capturing haystacks under different lighting and atmospheric conditions across the changing seasons.\\nThe work is a prime example of the artist\\u2019s deep exploration of color, light, and texture. Sharon Kim, Sotheby\\u2019s deputy chairman of Impressionist and modern art, highlighted the work\\u2019s pivotal role in Monet\\u2019s evolution: \\u201cIn revisiting scenes at different times of day and seasons, he carefully detailed the subtle changes in the landscape caused by the varying light and atmosphere to create a subtle and harmonious vision across his works,\\u201d she said in a statement at the time.\\nThis sale follows the 2019 sale of Monet\\u2019s\\nMeules\\n(1890), another work from the series that sold at Sotheby\\u2019s for $110 million. That work marked a record for Monet at auction and is the highest auction total for an\\nImpressionist\\nartwork.\\nVincent van Gogh\\n,\\nCoin de jardin avec papillon\\ns, 1887\\n$33,185,000\\nVincent van Gogh,\\nCoin de jardin avec papillons\\n, 1887.

Van Gogh painted this work during his second year in Paris, capturing luminous flower beds in the public gardens of Asni\\u00e8res, a suburban town along the Seine.\\nThe painting debuted at Christie\\u2019s New York in 2018, where it failed to sell at its Impressionist and modern art evening sale and was bought in by the auction house for $30 million.\\nThis sale breaks the record price of a Van Gogh painting made during the artist\\u2019s Paris period, which spanned from 1886 to 1888. The previous record was held by\\nGarden in front of the Debray Farm\\n(1887), which sold at Sotheby\\u2019s in May 2023 for $23 million.

The identity of its most recent consignor is unknown.\\nOne of the simpler compositions in Rothko\\u2019s oeuvre,\\nUntitled (Yellow and Blue)\\nfeatures two main blocks of color (yellow on top and blue beneath) with a narrow line of yellow at the bottom of the canvas.

Serving a total of almost 14 years, Rutte is the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history.\\nAfter originally embarking on a business management career working for\\nUnilever\\n, Rutte entered national politics in 2002 as a member of\\nJan Peter Balkenende\\n's cabinet. Rutte won the\\n2006 VVD leadership election\\nand led the party to victory in the\\n2010 general election\\n. After lengthy\\ncoalition negotiations\\n, he became prime minister of the Netherlands. He was the first self-described\\nliberal\\nto be appointed prime minister in 92 years.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAn impasse on budget negotiations led to his government's early collapse in April 2012, but the VVD's victory in the\\nsubsequent election\\nallowed Rutte to return as prime minister to lead\\nhis second cabinet\\nbetween the VVD and the\\nLabour Party\\n(PvdA), which became the first cabinet to complete a full four-year term since 1998. Though the VVD lost seats in the\\n2017 general election\\n, it remained the largest party. After a record-length formation period, Rutte was appointed to lead\\nhis third cabinet\\nbetween the VVD,\\nChristian Democratic Appeal\\n(CDA),\\nDemocrats 66\\n(D66) and\\nChristian Union\\n(CU).\\nThough Rutte and his cabinet resigned in response to the\\nDutch childcare benefits scandal\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nthe VVD would go on to win the\\n2021 general election\\n.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nRutte began his fourth term in 2022 after another record-length formation period. On 7 July 2023, he announced his government's resignation after the cabinet failed to agree on how to handle\\nmigration\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nRutte IV would continue on as an outgoing cabinet, fulfilling a caretaker function and keeping the nation running until the\\nSchoof cabinet\\nwas sworn in on 2 July 2024.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nFor his ability to remain in office until 2024 despite various political scandals,\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nRutte had been referred to as '\\nTeflon\\nMark' as \\\"nothing ever seemed to stick to him\\\".\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nHe has also been described by the\\nForeign Policy\\ncolumnist Caroline de Gruyter as ideologically flexible and pragmatic, willing to accommodate a broad range of political factions in order to address issues,\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nwhile the\\nGuardian\\ncorrespondent Jon Henley sees in him a \\\"managerial rather than a visionary leader\\\".\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nEarly life\\nRutte was born in\\nThe Hague\\n, in the\\nprovince\\nof\\nSouth Holland\\n,\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nto a\\nDutch Reformed\\nfamily. He is the youngest child of Iza\\u00e4k Rutte (5 October 1909 \\u2013 22 April 1988), a merchant, and his second wife Hermina Cornelia Dilling (13 November 1923 \\u2013 13 May 2020), a secretary. Iza\\u00e4k Rutte worked for a\\ntrading company\\n; first as an importer in the\\nDutch East Indies\\n; he later ran a car dealership.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nHis second wife was a sister of his first wife, Petronella Hermanna Dilling (17 March 1910 \\u2013 20 July 1945), who died while they were interned together in\\nTjideng\\n, a prisoner-of-war camp in\\nBatavia\\n(present-day\\nJakarta\\n, Indonesia), during\\nWorld War II\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nRutte has seven siblings as a result of his father's two marriages. One of his elder brothers died from AIDS in the 1980s. Rutte later described the deaths of his brother and his father as events that changed the course of his life.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nRutte attended the Maerlant Lyceum from 1979 until 1985,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nspecialising in the arts. Although his original ambition was to attend a conservatory and become a concert pianist,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nhe instead went to study history at\\nLeiden University\\n, where he obtained an\\nMA\\ndegree in 1992.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nRutte combined his studies with a position on the board of the\\nYouth Organisation Freedom and Democracy\\n, the youth organisation of the VVD, and served as chair of the organisation from 1988 to 1991.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nAfter his studies Rutte entered the business world, working as a manager for\\nUnilever\\nand its food subsidiary Calv\\u00e9. Until 1997, Rutte was part of the\\nhuman resource\\ndepartment of Unilever, and played a leading role in several reorganisations. Between 1997 and 2000, Rutte was staff manager of the subsidiary Van den Bergh Nederland. In 2000, Rutte became a member of the Corporate Human Resources Group, and in 2002, he became human resource manager for IgloMora Groep, another subsidiary of Unilever.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nPolitical career\\nBetween 1993 and 1997, Rutte was a member of the national board of the VVD.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nRutte served as State Secretary (i.e. Deputy Minister) at the\\nSocial Affairs and Employment Ministry\\nfrom 22 July 2002 to 17 June 2004 in the\\nFirst\\nand\\nSecond Balkenende cabinets\\nand was responsible for fields including\\nbijstand\\n(\\nmunicipal welfare\\n) and\\narbeidsomstandigheden\\n(\\nOccupational safety and health\\n). After the\\n2003 elections\\nRutte was briefly also a member of the\\nHouse of Representatives\\n, from 30 January to 27 May 2003.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 2003, Rutte supported the US-led\\ninvasion of Iraq\\n.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nDuring his time as State Secretary in 2003, Rutte advised municipalities to check Somali residents for social assistance fraud, after a number of Somalis who were working in England were found to be receiving social assistance benefits in the Netherlands as well. A Somali man entitled to benefits was stopped by social investigators and checked for fraud on the basis of his external characteristics, after which he refused the investigators access to his home. The Municipal Executive (\\nCollege van burgemeester en wethouders\\n) of\\nHaarlem\\ndecided to withdraw his right to social benefits. He disagreed with this and his appeal was upheld by the administrative judge. The court ruled that \\\"an investigation aimed exclusively at persons of Somali descent is discriminatory\\\" and contrary to the Constitution because this distinction is \\\"discrimination based on race\\\". Rutte rejected the criticism, stating that a change in the law would then be necessary to be able to combat targeted fraud.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nRutte later served as State Secretary for Higher Education and Science within the\\nEducation, Culture and Science Ministry\\nin the Second Balkenende Cabinet from 17 June 2004 to 27 June 2006, replacing\\nAnnette Nijs\\n. In office, Rutte showed particular interest in making the\\nDutch higher education system\\nmore competitive internationally, by trying to make it more market oriented (improving the position of students as consumers in the market for education). Rutte resigned from his position in government in June 2006 to return to the\\nHouse of Representatives\\n, and he soon became the\\nparliamentary leader\\nof the VVD.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nParty leadership election\\nAfter the resignation of\\nJozias van Aartsen\\nand a loss in the 2006 Dutch municipal election, the VVD held an\\ninternal election\\nfor a new Lead Candidate, in which Rutte competed against\\nRita Verdonk\\nand\\nJelleke Veenendaal\\n. On 31 May 2006, it was announced that Mark Rutte would be the next\\nlijsttrekker\\nof the VVD. He was elected by 51.5% of party members. Rutte's candidacy was backed by the VVD leadership, including the party board, and many prominent politicians such as\\nFrank de Grave\\n, former minister of Defence,\\nIvo Opstelten\\n, the mayor of\\nRotterdam\\nand\\nEd Nijpels\\n, the\\nQueen's Commissioner\\nof\\nFriesland\\n.

On 27 November, it became known that Rita Verdonk, who generally held a more populist view on politics, managed to obtain more votes than Mark Rutte; he obtained 553,200 votes against Verdonk's 620,555.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nAfter repeated criticisms by Verdonk on VVD policy, Rutte expelled her from the party's parliamentary faction on 13 September 2007.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\n2010 general election\\nIn the\\n2010 general election\\n, Rutte was once again the lead candidate for the VVD.

On 14 October, Queen Beatrix formally invited Rutte to form a government, and later that day, Rutte presented his\\nfirst cabinet\\nto Parliament. The government was confirmed in office by a majority of one, and Rutte was sworn in as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, becoming the first Liberal to serve in the role since\\nPieter Cort van der Linden\\nin 1918.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nAt 43 years old, he also became the second-youngest prime minister in Dutch history, after\\nRuud Lubbers\\n.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nNord Stream 1\\nopening ceremony on 8 November 2011 with Rutte, German Chancellor\\nAngela Merkel\\n, Russian president\\nDmitry Medvedev\\nand French prime minister\\nFran\\u00e7ois Fillon\\n.\\nAfter a victory in the\\n2011 provincial elections\\n, the VVD secured its status as the lead party within the government. In March 2012, seeking to comply with requirements from the\\nEuropean Union\\nto reduce the nation's deficit, Rutte began talks with his coalition partners on a budget which would cut 16 billion euros of government spending. However, PVV leader\\nGeert Wilders\\nwithdrew his party's informal support from the government on 21 April, stating that the proposed budget would hurt economic growth.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nThis led to the early collapse of the government and Rutte submitting his resignation to\\nQueen Beatrix\\non the afternoon of 23 April.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nHis government had lasted for 558 days, making it one of the shortest Dutch cabinets since World War II.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nSecond term\\nAhead of the\\n2012 general election\\n, Rutte was named the VVD's\\nlead candidate\\nfor the third time.

Rutte was judged to have managed the\\n2017 Dutch\\u2013Turkish diplomatic incident\\nwell according to similar polling. While the VVD lost 8 seats in the general election, the PvdA lost 29, and these seats were split between a number of other parties, leaving the VVD as the largest party in parliament for the third successive election. After holding coalition discussions, Rutte negotiated a grand coalition with the\\nCDA\\n,\\nD66\\nand\\nCU\\n; he presented his\\nthird cabinet\\non 26 October 2017 and was sworn in as prime minister for a third term.

The Celtics'\\nJaylen Brown\\nwas voted the\\nNBA Finals Most Valuable Player\\n(FMVP), after averaging 20.8 points, 5.4\\nrebounds\\nand 5.0\\nassists\\nper game. For his performances and plays in the series, Brown received seven out of the 11 votes for FMVP; the rest went to his teammate\\nJayson Tatum\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nThe Celtics were seen as favorites for winning the championship, finishing with a 64\\u201318 record, the best across the league, and quickly dispatching their opponents during their playoff run.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nMeanwhile, the Mavericks only became a Finals contender midway through the season after a series of roster changes, finishing as the fifth seed in their conference.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nThe series started on June 6 and concluded on June 17.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nThe Celtics won the first two games at home. In Dallas, the Celtics were initially on their way to a dominant Game 3 victory, but the Mavericks went on a run in the fourth quarter to jeopardize it. The Celtics nonetheless pulled through, winning the game and putting them up 3\\u20130 in the series. The next game, the Mavericks responded with one of the largest blowout victories in NBA Finals history, but the Celtics made easy work of Dallas upon their return to Boston, winning Game 5 and claiming the championship.\\nAfter the defending champion\\nDenver Nuggets\\nwere bested by the\\nMinnesota Timberwolves\\n(who were later defeated by the Mavericks) in the second round of the playoffs, it guaranteed that there would be a sixth unique champion team in a row, the longest such parity streak in NBA Finals history since\\n1975\\n\\u2013\\n1980\\n.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nThe streak continued with the Celtics being eliminated in\\nthe second round of the 2025 playoffs\\n.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nBackground\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nGeneral\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Mavericks, as well as all teams from the\\nGreater Boston\\nand\\nDallas\\u2013Fort Worth\\nareas in any of the\\nfour major North American sports leagues\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nIt was also the third Finals appearance for the Celtics where they played a team from\\nTexas\\n, as they previously did so defeating the\\nHouston Rockets\\nin the\\n1981\\nand\\n1986\\nFinals.

Out of those five, only one, the Rockets in\\n1995\\n, won the championship.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIf the Mavericks were to have won, they would have become the 11th NBA team to win multiple championship titles.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nBoston Celtics\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\n2023\\u201324 Boston Celtics season\\nHead coach\\nJoe Mazzulla\\nled the Celtics to the Finals, becoming the youngest ever to do so.\\nAfter losing the\\n2022 NBA Finals\\n, the\\nBoston Celtics\\nwere defeated in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals in seven games after mounting a failed 3\\u20130 comeback attempt.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nDuring the off-season, the Celtics were involved in a trade which sent out longtime guard\\nMarcus Smart\\nin exchange for\\nKristaps Porzi\\u0146\\u0123is\\n.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nThey also acquired defensive guard\\nJrue Holiday\\nwhile trading away\\nRobert Williams III\\n,\\nMalcolm Brogdon\\nand two first-round draft picks.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nThe retooled roster was once again led by the '\\nJays\\n',\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nthe longtime duo of\\nJayson Tatum\\nand\\nJaylen Brown\\n, with support from the\\ntwo-way\\nbackcourt of Holiday and\\nDerrick White\\nand rotating centers Porzi\\u0146\\u0123is and\\nAl Horford\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nWith an offense prioritizing\\nthree-point-shooting\\nand a versatile roster of defenders,\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nthe Celtics dominated throughout the season, winning all of their first 20 games at home,\\n[\\n17\\n]\\npermanently occupying the first seed position of the Eastern Conference since mid-November,\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nand finishing with a league-best 64\\u201318 record\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nand the highest Eastern Conference win percentage since the\\n2012\\u201313 Miami Heat\\n's.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nBoston set numerous records during the season, such as having the highest offensive rating in NBA history at 123.2,\\n[\\n4\\n]\\ntying the third-best net rating in NBA history at 11.6,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nhaving the widest margin of wins between the first and second seeds in the Eastern Conference since 1976 at 14 games, outscoring teams by an average of 11.3 points per game, the fifth-widest margin in NBA history, and having the highest points per possession (1.22) in league history.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference Finals, and won the series 4\\u20131.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThey then faced the\\nCleveland Cavaliers\\nin the second round, winning again in five games. Finally, after three hard-fought games and a blowout, they swept the\\nIndiana Pacers\\nin the Conference Finals to reach the NBA Finals.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nDue to injuries to key players on all three opposing teams during their run through the Eastern Conference playoffs, the Celtics' path to the Finals was considered by media writers as one of the easiest in NBA history.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nThe Celtics had the best point differential in the playoffs at plus-10, the second-best points-per-game average at 111.4, the first being the Pacers, and allowed the third-lowest points per game for their opponents with 101.3.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nEven as starting center Porzi\\u0146\\u0123is, who suffered a soleus strain in Game 4 of the first round, was sidelined for the next two rounds, the Celtics went 9\\u20131 without him.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nThis was the 23th appearance in the NBA Finals for the Celtics, and their second in three years.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nMedia commentators, analysts and the Celtics themselves\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nviewed the team as in a \\\"championship or bust\\\" scenario, their regular season and playoff achievements invalidated if they were not to win the Finals.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nA Finals victory would give the Celtics their 18th championship, one more than the\\nLos Angeles Lakers\\nfor the most in NBA history.

Irving and Don\\u010di\\u0107 both missed significant amounts of games during that period due to injuries,\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nwhile injuries also affected other roster pieces as owner\\nMark Cuban\\nsold his majority share of the franchise in December.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAt the trade deadline, the Mavericks made more major changes to the roster, exchanging Williams and Curry for power forward\\nP. J. Washington\\nand acquiring center\\nDaniel Gafford\\n. The two players would further compliment the Irving\\u2013Don\\u010di\\u0107 backcourt by significantly reinforcing the team's defense into a powerhouse. The trade has been regarded as the catalyst for the Mavericks morphing into championship contenders by the next month. From March 7 onwards, the Mavericks had the best defensive rating, the 12th-best offensive rating and the fifth-best net rating in the league, and went on 16\\u20134 to end the season.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nFrom February 1 onwards, Dallas had a 36\\u201315 record: the second best in the league behind the Celtics.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nThey eventually finished as the fifth seed in the Western Conference with a 50\\u201332 overall record.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nFor the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks faced the\\nLos Angeles Clippers\\n, who had eliminated them in two first-round series in the five years prior. The Mavericks won the series in six games.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nIn the second round they faced the first-seeded\\nOklahoma City Thunder\\n. The Mavericks overcame a 16-point halftime deficit in Game 6 to eliminate the Thunder, advancing to their second Western Conference Finals in three years.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter defeating the\\nMinnesota Timberwolves\\nin the first three games of the Conference Finals with a combined total of 13 points, dropping Game 4, and winning Game 5 in a 21-point blowout,\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nthe Mavericks secured their first NBA Finals appearance in 13 years and their third in franchise history.

Voting for the nominations, which began on January 8, 2025, was originally planned to end four days later. However, due to the wildfires which affected several Academy members, the voting period was extended by five more days ending on January 17. The nominations announcement was also delayed nearly a week to January 23.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nIn addition, the annual Academy nominees luncheon originally scheduled for February 10 was cancelled, and the Scientific and Technical Awards gala initially planned for February 18 was delayed by two months to April 29.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nAt the start of the broadcast, a montage paying tribute to Los Angeles featuring clips from films such as\\nBarbie\\n(2023),\\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\\n(2022),\\nLa La Land\\n(2016),\\nMulholland Drive\\n(2001), and\\nThe Wizard of Oz\\n(1939) was shown prior to\\nAriana Grande\\n's performance of \\\"\\nOver the Rainbow\\n\\\".\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nDuring the broadcast, a\\nQR code\\nwas displayed providing a link containing resources for fire relief efforts.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nLater, host O'Brien brought onstage a group of twelve firefighters and other first responders and thanked them for their service during wildfires.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nThree of those members,\\nLos Angeles Fire Department\\n(LAFD) captain Erik Scott, LAFD helicopter pilot Jonith Johnson Jr., and\\nPasadena\\nFire Department Captain Jodi Slicker, delivered jokes onstage to the audience due to O'Brien jokingly claiming, \\\"There are some jokes even I'm not brave enough to tell.\\\"\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nFor the first time, the broadcast was made available for streaming live on\\nHulu\\n.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nThe simulcast on said streaming platform was notably met with technical issues such as crashing multiple times throughout the ceremony and prematurely ending the stream just before the Best Actress nominees were announced; Hulu apologized the following day.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nNotable changes were introduced in the production of the telecast. In a break from previous presentations, the awards for Best Costume Design and Best Cinematography were presented by five actors, one of whom was featured in each of the nominated films in the category.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nThe format was similar to how the acting awards were presented at the\\n81st\\nand\\n96th\\nceremonies in 2009 and 2024, respectively.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nThe Academy also announced that none of the five nominees for Best Original Song would be performed live during the gala.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nIn lieu of the performances, each of the nominated songs was highlighted through personal reflections and behind-the-scenes insight from the creative teams responsible for the nominees.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nSeveral others participated in the production of the ceremony and related events. Musician Michael Bearden was the musical director for the telecast. Production designer Misty Buckley and Alana Billingsley designed a new stage for the show.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nComedian and journalist\\nAmelia Dimoldenberg\\nserved as a social media and red carpet correspondent for the Oscar's online outlets.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nChoreographer\\nMandy Moore\\noversaw the\\nJames Bond\\nmusical tribute which featured performances from\\nLisa\\n,\\nDoja Cat\\n, and\\nRaye\\n, and an appearance in the beginning by actress and dancer\\nMargaret Qualley\\n.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nBest Picture theatrical qualification and other rule changes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn June 2023, the Academy announced that, starting with the 97th awards, all films submitted for Best Picture would have to comply with several standards regarding their theatrical runs.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nIn a press release, AMPAS president\\nJanet Yang\\nand Academy CEO\\nBill Kramer\\nsaid of the new standards, \\\"In support of our mission to celebrate and honor the arts and sciences of moviemaking, it is our hope that this expanded theatrical footprint will increase the visibility of films worldwide and encourage audiences to experience our artform in a theatrical setting. Based on many conversations with industry partners, we feel that this evolution benefits film artists and movie lovers alike.\\\"\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nMany media outlets pointed out that the new rules were drafted in response to the growing presence of streaming platforms such as\\nAmazon Prime Video\\n,\\nApple TV+\\n, and\\nNetflix\\nsubmitting their films for awards consideration.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nAccording to the new rules, in addition to the previous requirement where prospective films must play theatrically for a week in either Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Atlanta, or Miami,\\n[\\nc\\n]\\nthey also would have to be shown in an expanded seven-day theatrical run in 10 of the top 50 US markets. The expanded theatrical run would have to occur within 45 days after the film's initial release in the eligibility year, and can be shown in either consecutive or nonconsecutive days. For films released later in the calendar year with expansions after January 10, distributors would have to submit to AMPAS release plans for verification and the theatrical run would have to be completed no later than January 24. Non-American films could also have theatrical runs in two markets outside the US to be counted toward ten theatrical markets needed for consideration. However, these films would have to release in the top 15 international theatrical markets in addition to the film's country of origin.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nAdditional rule changes were also approved by the AMPAS Board of Governors in April 2024.\\nDrive-in theaters\\n, which were temporarily allowed as a venue to meet qualification and eligibility standards during the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\n, would be no longer recognized as a method to fulfill requirements for consideration.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nIn the Best Original Score category, up to three composers can receive individual statuettes if all composers contribute significantly to a film's musical score. Additionally, the shortlist for the aforementioned category would increase from fifteen to twenty films. For the screenplay awards, all films must submit a final shooting script to be eligible for consideration in either category. Animated feature films submitted for consideration in the Best International Feature Film category may also be eligible for the Best Animated Feature award provided they meet the rules outlined for both categories. Finally, recipients of the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award will now receive an Oscar statuette as opposed to a bust of Thalberg in previous years.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBox office performance of Best Picture nominees\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWhen the nominations were announced, nine of the ten films nominated for Best Picture had earned a combined gross of $900\\u00a0million at the American and Canadian box offices at the time.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nWicked\\nwas the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $466\\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts.\\nDune: Part Two\\ncame in second with $283\\u00a0million; this was followed by\\nA Complete Unknown\\n($59\\u00a0million),\\nConclave\\n($32\\u00a0million),\\nThe Substance\\n($17\\u00a0million),\\nAnora\\n($15\\u00a0million),\\nThe Brutalist\\n($6\\u00a0million),\\nNickel Boys\\n($1.1\\u00a0million), and\\nI'm Still Here\\n($162,000).\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nThe box office figures for\\nEmilia P\\u00e9rez\\nwere unavailable due to distributor Netflix's policy of refusing to release such figures.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nCritical reviews\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nVariety\\nfilm critic\\nOwen Gleiberman\\ncalled the show \\\"a brisk and elegantly executed piece of media stagecraft, successful in more ways than not. It was lavishly designed and purged of dead spots, and the winners were given the chance to reveal who they were, which is really the heart of the show.\\\"\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nColumnist Brian Lowry of\\nTheWrap\\ncommented, \\\"The 97th Academy Awards largely mastered the delicate mechanics of that juggling act, acknowledging weightier matters \\u2014 such as bringing out Los Angeles firefighters for an extended ovation \\u2014 while seeking to provide a sense of playfulness, even silliness, courtesy of host Conan O'Brien.\\\"\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nTelevision critic Judy Berman of\\nTime\\npraised O'Brien's hosting performance writing, \\\"Whenever O'Brien was onstage, balancing impish humor with a palpable love for movies and compassion for an industry where so many recently lost so much to the wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles, the ceremony felt light and loose.\\\" She concluded her remarks by stating, \\\"Still, the best moments of this hosting gig were just Conan being Conan, letting the winners enjoy their spotlight and laughing at himself to make everyone else feel comfortable.\\\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nKelly Lawler of\\nUSA Today\\nreserved praise for O'Brien and the winners' speeches, but she wrote, \\\"Inoffensive and somewhat bland, the 2025 Oscars lacked passion and fervor, or a distinctive hook that makes the ceremony more than just a generic recitation of winners.\\\"\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nTelevision critic Daniel Fienberg of\\nThe Hollywood Reporter\\nremarked, \\\"I'm perfectly happy to pretend that this telecast was the show we deserved at this point in history, when everything feels so unstable. But maybe it was just an uneven mess. Who's to say?\\\" He criticized several decisions such as dropping the performances of the Best Original Song nominees in favor of musical tributes to James Bond and Quincy Jones that contributed to the telecast's bloated runtime, but he commended O'Brien's hosting performance and called writing during the gala \\\"impressively sharp\\\".\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nThe Detroit News\\nfilm critic Adam Graham commented, \\\"Sunday night's Academy Awards telecast was severely lacking in the movie star razzle dazzle we look forward to on the broadcast. Coming at the end of a packed awards and entertainment season, it felt more like reheated leftovers than it did Hollywood's biggest night.\\\"\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nRatings and reception\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 19.69\\u00a0million people over its length, which was a 1% increase from the previous year's ceremony.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nIn addition, it garnered a higher 18\\u201349 demo rating with a 4.54 rating among viewers in that demographic.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nRatings figures included those who watched the telecast on ABC, streamed it on Hulu, or viewed it on computers, tablets, and other digital devices.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe positive critical reviews and strong ratings figures led the Academy to select O'Brien to host the\\nfollowing year's ceremony\\nscheduled for March 15, 2026, with producers Kapoor and Mullan also being hired for that ceremony.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nIn July 2025, the broadcast was nominated for six awards at the\\n77th Primetime Emmy Awards\\nand its corresponding\\nCreative Arts Awards\\n.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nTwo months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for\\nOutstanding Production Design for a Variety Special\\n(Production Designers: Alana Billingsley and Misty Buckley; Art Directors: John Zuiker and Margaux LaPresle).\\n[\\n73\\n]\\n\\\"In Memoriam\\\"\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe annual \\\"In Memoriam\\\" segment, presented by\\nMorgan Freeman\\n, featured the\\nLos Angeles Master Chorale\\nperforming \\\"\\nLacrimosa\\n\\\" from\\nRequiem\\nby\\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\n.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nThe following individuals were honored during the tribute:\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nMaggie Smith\\n\\u2013 actress\\nGena Rowlands\\n\\u2013 actress\\nDabney Coleman\\n\\u2013 actor\\nLourdes Portillo\\n\\u2013 documentary filmmaker\\nDick Pope\\n\\u2013 cinematographer\\nPhyllis Dalton\\n\\u2013 costume designer\\nDavid Seidler\\n\\u2013 writer\\nRoger Corman\\n\\u2013 director, producer\\nJeff Baena\\n\\u2013 director, writer\\nDianne Crittenden\\n\\u2013 casting director\\nBob Newhart\\n\\u2013 actor\\nKris Kristofferson\\n\\u2013 actor, songwriter\\nMarshall Brickman\\n\\u2013 director, writer\\nRobert Laemmle\\n\\u2013 exhibitor\\nM.

This question is top of mind for travelers, especially in the wake of a\\nfiery Japan Airlines crash in Tokyo\\n.\\nAirlineRatings.com\\n, an airline safety and product rating review site, has the answer in its new ranking of the 25 safest airlines in the world.\\nNOTE: This story is old. To see the latest list of the safest airlines in the world, check out\\n\\u201cThe Safest Airlines In The World In 2025, Ranked In A New Report\\u201d\\nAirlineRatings.com rates the safety and in-flight product of 385 airlines using its own unique seven-star rating system. In making its evaluation, the site considers a comprehensive range of factors, including serious incidents, recent fatal accidents, audits from aviation\\u2019s governing and industry bodies, industry-leading safety initiatives, expert pilot training assessment,  fleet age and more. However, the evaluation leaves out such things that airlines have no control over, such as bird strikes, turbulence injuries, weather diversions and lightning strikes.\\nIn past years, the site issued a list of\\nthe top 20 airlines\\n; this year, it expanded the list to 25 of the largest and best-known carriers. \\u201cThis year we went for a top 25 because the margins were so small between these airlines,\\u201d Geoffrey Thomas, the editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, told me in an interview.\\nA new report has ranked the world's safest airlines for 2024.\\ngetty\\nCapturing the top spot for 2024 is Air New Zealand, which edged out the competition, setting a new benchmark in airline safety and operational excellence. Air New Zealand also won in 2022. \\u201cAir New Zealand operates in some of the most challenging weather environments which test pilot skills,\\u201d says Thomas. \\u201cWellington is one of the most windy airports in the world, while Queenstown is a huge navigation challenge.\\u201d\\nMORE FROM\\nFORBES ADVISOR\\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\\nBy\\nKevin Payne\\nContributor\\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\\nBy\\nCassidy Horton\\nContributor\\nAnother hallmark of Air New Zealand: \\u201cThe airline has focused on the latest technology and its aircraft are state of the art in that respect,\\u201d says Thomas.\\nComing in second on the list is Qantas, which won in 2023\\u2014though, according to Thomas, the safety margin was very small between Air New Zealand and Qantas. \\u201cBetween Air New Zealand and Qantas there is only 1.5 points\\u2014it\\u2019s incredibly close,\\u201d says Thomas.\\nWhat pulled Qantas down: \\u201cQantas slipped on fleet age, which the airline will address in 2024 with new fleets arriving,\\u201d says Thomas.\\nInternational carriers dominate the list of safest airlines. When it comes to U.S. carriers, only one is on the top 10 list: Alaska Airlines, which comes in number 10. (The airline slipped two points from 2023, when it ranked number eight). Hawaiian Airlines ranks number 21\\u2014a big drop from 2023 when it was number 12. American Airlines ranks number 22 (down from number 19 in 2023) and United Airlines ranks number 25 (down from number 14 in 2023).\\n\\u201cThe U.S. carriers rankings are dragged down by the fleet age of their aircraft, however all have major replacement programs in place but it will take time for that to reflect in the rankings,\\u201d says Thomas.\\nAnd as he points out: \\u201cThe rankings of all airlines include incidents against flights and fleet age. However the scoring was very tight.\\u201d\\nWhen it comes to the low-cost carriers, Jetstar\\u2014an Australian airline owned by Qantas\\u2014comes in number one. The top-ranking low-cost U.S. carrier is Frontier, which ranks number six beating out Southwest (at number nine), Sun Country (at number 14) and Spirit (number 15) and JetBlue (number 17).\\nScroll down to see both lists: the world\\u2019s top 25 safest airlines and the safest low-cost airlines.\\nAir New Zealand has been named the world's safest airline in 2024.\\ngetty\\nThe Top 25 Safest Airlines For 2024\\nAir New Zealand\\nQantas\\nVirgin Australia\\nEtihad Airways\\nQatar Airways\\nEmirates\\nAll Nippon Airways\\nFinnair\\nCathay Pacific Airways\\nAlaska Airlines\\nSAS\\nKorean Air\\nSingapore Airlines\\nEVA Air\\nBritish Airways\\nTurkish Airlines\\nTAP Air Portugal\\nLufthansa/Swiss Group\\nKLM\\nJapan Airlines\\nHawaiian Airlines\\nAmerican Airlines\\nAir France\\nAir Canada Group\\nUnited Airlines\\nJetstar has been named the world's safest low-cost carrier.\\ngetty\\nThe 20 Safest Low-Cost Airlines For 2024\\nJetstar\\neasyJet\\nRyanair\\nWizz\\nNorwegian\\nFrontier\\nVueling\\nVietjet\\nSouthwest\\nVolaris\\nflydubai\\nAirAsia Group\\nCebu Pacific\\nSun Country\\nSpirit\\nWestjet\\nJetBlue\\nAir Arabia\\nIndigo\\nEurowings\\nMORE FROM FORBES:\\nEditorial Standards\\nReprints & Permissions\\nLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...\\nFORBES\\u2019 FEATURED Video\\n\\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Joseph Homer Parker founded a private women's\\nCongregational\\npreparatory school which was supported mainly by Wichita's Plymouth Congregational Church, Parker's church. The school never opened its doors.\\nCalled the \\\"Young Ladies College,\\\" \\\"Wichita Ladies College\\\" and \\\"Congregational Female College\\\" and founded during a boom in college and university creation, the private school was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older. In early 1887, the project's leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and, in response, renamed their school\\nFairmount College\\n. Envisioned to be the \\\"Vassar of the West,\\\" the streets of the neighboring residential areas were named after prominent women's colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. The street names remain in 2023.\\nIn 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school\\nFairmount Institute\\n. Also known as Fairmount Academy, this Congregational church prep school opened in September to boys and girls age 12 and above.\\nIn 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. The society selected Nathan Jackson Morrison to be the president of the new college.\\nDuring the 1900s and 1910s, the school grew with structures including a men's dormitory, Fiske Hall, begun in 1904 and dedicated June 1906, and a Carnegie library, built in 1908, occupied in January 1909 and dedicated in January 1910.\\nFairmount trustees decided to phase out and eventually close the institute after the 1915 school year. For 20 years, students of the institute formed the nucleus of Fairmount College's student body.\\nThe school's mascot, the \\\"wheatshockers,\\\" came about during a football game in 1906 and referred to the fact that many of the football players also shocked wheat during the harvest.\\nAmid growing financial troubles in the 1920s, the college's supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the\\nMunicipal University of Wichita\\n(popularly known as \\\"Wichita University\\\" or \\\"WU\\\"). It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi.\\nBy the 1950s, university leaders and President Harry Corbin explored adding the institution to the State of Kansas Regents System along with the University of Kansas and Kansas State University. These two schools had powerful friends who did not feel that the University of Wichita was on par with the state's two main universities. It took a concerted lobbying effort on the part of WU boosters to persuade the legislature and governor to agree to the change. On July 1, 1964, the school officially entered the state system of higher education as Wichita State University.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nLocated on campus is the original building of the first Pizza Hut. The original building was located at Kellogg and Bluff. An effort to move it out of the path of Kellogg expansion resulted in the building coming to Wichita State University in the 1980s. After three decades of being located near the campus water tower, the building underwent a second move. In 2017, the university moved it to its current location on the Innovation Campus.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nCampuses\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe main campus is located at 1845 North Fairmount in northeast Wichita, is mostly bounded between the streets of 17th St N, 21st St N, Hillside St, Oliver Ave. The Hughes Metropolitan Complex and Advanced Education in General Dentistry buildings, located at the intersection of 29th St N and Oliver Ave, are considered part of the main campus.  There are seven satellite campuses.\\nSince July 1, 2018, the\\nCampus of Applied Sciences and Technology\\n, also known as \\\"WSU Tech\\\" and formerly known as the Wichita Area Technical College, is located at 4004 N.

The plan kicked off with the completion of renovations to the university's student union, the Rhatigan Student Center, and the opening of Shocker Hall, a new 318,000-square-foot, 784-bed housing facility on the main campus. Subsequent development has taken place on the site of the former Braeburn Golf Course, a WSU-owned course adjacent to campus which closed in November 2014.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nGround broke on the first building, the Technology Transfer/Experiential Learning Building, in Q1 2015.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nThe university has secured on-campus partnerships with multiple companies including Sunnyvale, Calif.-based\\nNetApp\\n, which moved its entire Wichita operations into a new building on campus;\\nAirbus\\n;\\nDeloitte\\n;\\nTextron Aviation\\n;\\nBoston Consulting Group\\n; and\\nDassault Syst\\u00e8mes\\nto name a few.

Also, it offers club sports such as crew, bowling, shooting sports, and other intramural sports.\\nShockers\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe name for WSU's athletic teams is the Shockers and students are also collectively referred to as \\\"Shockers.\\\" The name reflects the university's heritage: Early students earned money by shocking, or harvesting, wheat in nearby fields. Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nAlthough the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol. WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school.  The October 7, 1948, issue of\\nThe Sunflower\\n, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. The winning name was \\\"WuShock.\\\"\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nDuring the 1980s, WuShock briefly had a sidekick named WeeShock, that was introduced as an attempt to make the mascot more appealing to children.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nIn 1998,\\nWuShock\\n, also referred to as \\\"Wu,\\\" marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help. Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nBasketball\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCharles Koch Arena\\nis home to the\\nWichita State Shockers\\nmen's\\nand women's basketball and women's volleyball teams.

The Croat reigned supreme at the 2024 Hangzhou Open, beating Zhang Zhizhen 7-6(5), 7-6(5) in the final to win the 21st title of his career in singles.\\nAd\\nCilic started the tournament as the World No. 777, the result of a long injury break from the tour. Coming back from knee surgery just last month, he played in a couple of Challenger events before returning to the ATP Tour at Hangzhou with a wildcard.\\nExpand Tweet\\nAd\\nTrending\\nIn his opener, Cilic took down Zachary Svajda, and he followed that with a win over Yoshihito Nishioka in the second round. Then, he defeated Yasutaka Uchiyama to move into the semifinals, where he overcame fourth seed Brandon Nakashima to reach the summit clash.\\nExpand Tweet\\nAd\\nMarin Cilic's last title came back in 2021 when he won the Stuttgart Open on grass. He began his 2022 season at the Tata Open Maharashtra but had to withdraw from the tournament midway as his knee troubles resurfaced.\\nCilic has already risen several places and is currently ranked World No. 373 this week. With the ATP 250 title, he is set to rise even higher; the Croat is sitting at No. 212 in the live rankings.\\nAd\\nIt should be noted that because the Hangzhou Open started in the middle of last week, Cilic entered the tournament with the ranking of No. 777, allowing him the chance to make history. Before him, the record was held by former World No. 1\\nLleyton Hewitt\\n, who won the 1998 Adelaide title as the World No. 550.\\nWhere is Marin Cilic in action next?\\nMarin Cilic at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open - Day 3 - Source: Getty\\nFollowing his title win at the Hangzhou Open, Marin Cilic is set to be in action next at the ATP 500 Japan Open. In his opener, he is drawn to take on\\nKei Nishikori\\n, setting up a rematch of their 2014 US Open final, where Cilic prevailed to win his maiden and only Grand Slam title so far.\\nAlso in action at the Japan Open are the likes of Stefanos Tsitsipas, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe, and Taylor Fritz. Fritz, the American No. 1, is the top seed at the tournament, while Hubert Hurkacz is the No. 2 seed. A win against Nishikori would pit Cilic against either Jordan Thompson or third seed\\nCasper Ruud\\nin the second round.\\n\\u00d7\\nWas this article helpful?\\nThank You for feedback\\nQuick Links\\nUS Open Tennis 2025\\nMarin Cilic\\nZhizhen Zhang\\nMen's tennis trending news\\nNewsNow Tennis\\nHas Marin Cilic ever won a Grand Slam?\\nMore from Sportskeeda\\nEdited by Shyam Kamal\\nMore from Sportskeeda\\nFetching more content...\\nWhat's your opinion?\\nPost as Guest\\n*No login required\\nCancel\\nPost\\n1\\n\\u2715\\n\\u2715\\nNo Results Found\\nWWE\\nNBA\\nNFL\\nMMA\\nTennis\\nNHL\\nGolf\\nMLB\\nSoccer\\nF1\\nWNBA\\nMore\\nNCAAF\\nNCAAB\\nNASCAR\\nPopular\\nImportant Links\\nAbout Us\\nWrite For Us\\nPolicies\\nGrievance Redressal\\nEditorial Standards\\nFact Check\\nAffiliate Program\\nCareers\\nCSR\\nPrivacy Policy\\nContact Us\\nManage notifications\"}"}], "step_2": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': 'Marin Cilic, born in Croatia, was the lowest-ranked tennis player to win an ATP Tour title according to the Guinness World Records in 2024.', 'context': 'Marin Cilic made history at the 2024 Hangzhou Open by winning the ATP Tour title while ranked World No. 777, the lowest ranking ever for a title winner.

In addition to that, Acad\\u00e9mica also reached the\\n2009\\u201310 Portuguese League Cup\\nsemi-finals, losing against Porto at the\\nEst\\u00e1dio do Drag\\u00e3o\\nto a late goal from\\nMariano Gonz\\u00e1lez\\n. His impact at Acad\\u00e9mica was immediate, not only because of solid results, but also because of the attractive football displayed by the team, which led to intense media speculation linking him with the vacant jobs at\\nSporting CP\\nand Porto in the summer of 2010.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nPorto\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nVillas-Boas as manager of\\nPorto\\nin 2011\\nVillas-Boas signed a deal to become the new manager of Porto on 2 June 2010.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nTwo months later, he won his first trophy as a manager when Porto defeated\\nBenfica\\n2\\u20130 to win the\\nPortuguese Supercup\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nVillas-Boas went on to immense success with Porto, leading the team to an\\nundefeated season in the Primeira Liga\\n\\u2014only the second time this had ever been achieved\\u2014and winning the title by more than 20 points, having conceded only 13 goals all season. Villas-Boas went on to follow up this success by leading Porto to win both the\\nPortuguese Cup\\nand the\\nUEFA Europa League\\n, thus completing a\\ntreble\\nin his first season in charge. By doing so, Villas-Boas became the third-youngest coach ever to win the Primeira Liga (behind Mih\\u00e1ly Siska in\\n1939\\nand\\nJuca\\nin\\n1962\\n) and the youngest manager ever to win a European competition, at the age of 33 years and 213 days.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nOn 21 June 2011, Villas-Boas tendered his resignation as Porto manager.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nChelsea\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nVillas-Boas managing\\nChelsea\\nin 2012\\nChelsea confirmed the appointment of Andr\\u00e9 Villas-Boas as its new manager on a three-year contract with immediate effect on 22 June 2011.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIt indirectly paid Porto\\na world record\\n\\u20ac\\n15\\nmillion (\\n\\u00a3\\n13.3\\nmillion) compensation via Villas-Boas to activate his release clause and free him from his contract with Porto.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nHe won all of his pre-season fixtures with Chelsea, the team conceding only one goal in all six games.

He then won his first competitive match as Chelsea manager, defeating\\nWest Bromwich Albion\\n2\\u20131 on 20 August. He continued his season with a home win, beating\\nNorwich City\\n3\\u20131. On 18 September 2011, Villas-Boas's Chelsea lost to\\nManchester United\\n3\\u20131 at\\nOld Trafford\\n.

Days later, he once again lost to Liverpool in a 2\\u20130 defeat in the\\nLeague Cup\\nquarter-final.\\nOn 11 February 2012, pressure began to mount on Villas-Boas as Chelsea dropped out of the top four in the Premier League following a 2\\u20130 league defeat against\\nEverton\\n.

The team managed to pick up vital points in order to pursue their top four ambition. Promising big scorelines away from home such as against\\nFulham\\n,\\nAston Villa\\nand\\nSunderland\\nalong with home wins against\\nSwansea City\\nand Reading, left Tottenham in third place going into the new year. One set back was a tough trip to\\nGoodison Park\\n, where Spurs were leading up until the 90th minute, before two late\\nEverton\\ngoals in as many minutes, snatched victory away from the North London side.\\nIn February 2013, he guided Tottenham to the last 16 of the\\nEuropa League\\nafter a last minute goal from\\nMousa Demb\\u00e9l\\u00e9\\n, securing a 1\\u20131 draw against\\nLyon\\nat the\\nStade Gerland\\n. Spurs won the tie 3\\u20132 on aggregate, after a 2\\u20131 win at home the previous week. Following a 3\\u20132 away win at\\nWest Ham United\\n, Tottenham's third win from three Premier League matches that month, Villas-Boas picked up his second piece of personal Tottenham silverware of the season as he was awarded the Manager of the Month award for February, along with\\nGareth Bale\\nwho picked up the Player of the Month award for February as well.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nOn the final day of the Premier League season, Tottenham sat a point behind\\nNorth London rivals\\n,\\nArsenal\\n, knowing that in order to qualify for the\\n2013\\u201314 Champions League\\n, they had to win and hope that Arsenal failed to win. Tottenham won against Sunderland, but did not qualify due to Arsenal's 0\\u20131 win at Newcastle United. Even though Tottenham finished a point behind the Champions League playoff spot, they set a new club record by finishing with 72 points.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nThis was also the highest points tally ever achieved by any club in the Premier League to consequently not finish in the top four, until Arsenal finishing in fifth with 75 points in\\n2016-17\\n.\\nIn the close season, Villas-Boas claimed he was approached by both\\nParis Saint-Germain\\nand\\nReal Madrid\\nto fill their managerial vacancies\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nbut insisted he rejected these offers to remain with Spurs for a second successive season, something which he had not previously done as a manager.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nFollowing the sale of star player Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for a world record fee of \\u00a385.3 million,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nVillas-Boas was active in the transfer market before the start of the\\n2013\\u201314 Premier League\\nseason.

Bolstered by the talents of Brazilians\\nHulk\\nand\\nOscar\\nas well as star Chinese attacker\\nWu Lei\\n, his only season at the helm saw SIPG finish second in the league, losing to rivals Shanghai Shenhua in the final of the Chinese FA cup, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League, the club's best result in the competition to date (as of November 2019).\\nVillas-Boas' stint at SIPG was also marred by a number of controversial remarks he made throughout the campaign, some of which were in response to star midfielder Oscar's controversial 8-match suspension for kicking the ball at an opponent during play.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nHe also repeatedly lambasted match officials for favouring eventual league champions\\nGuangzhou Evergrande\\n, notably following a game between Guangzhou and\\nYanbian Funde\\nwhere Guangzhou defender\\nLiu Jian\\nscored following a handball gifting Guangzhou a crucial victory.

For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don't come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there's been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They've been ordered from least to most expensive, and we've only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\n10\\nMcLaren W1\\n$2,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,258 hp\\nTorque\\n988 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n2.7 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 399 units\\nIt's been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand's \\\"World Championship\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company's first Driver's and Constructor's World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\nGoogle News\\nFollow On\\nGoogle News\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\nExpand\\nCollapse\\nObviously, there's a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand's famous design language. It's everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\n9\\nBertone GB110\\n$2,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nV8\\nHorsepower\\n1,108 hp\\nTorque\\n811 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-186 mph\\n12.9 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 33\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\nthe design house's first hypercar\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn't worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it'll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we'll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer's hands.\\n8\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\n~$2,300,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\nHorsepower\\n739 hp\\nTorque\\n737 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n209 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n3.3 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 16\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley's incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it's the convertible version of the\\nBatur\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it's every bit as\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\n.\\nRelated\\nHow Bentley's Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\nPosts\\n1\\nBy\\nRyan De Villiers\\nAug 2, 2024\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they'll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they'll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\n7\\nAston Martin Valiant\\n$2,500,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n734 hp\\nTorque\\n555 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 38\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\nValiant\\n, which is an evolution of the\\nValour\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand's incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it's mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn't announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\n6\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\n$2,650,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\nHorsepower\\n1,817 hp\\nTorque\\n1,193 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 12\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we're not surprised it's unveiled a\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it's an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\nRelated\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\nPosts\\nBy\\nKyle Francis\\nDec 6, 2024\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it's also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we're stuck dreaming.\\n5\\nF80\\n$3,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,184 hp\\nTorque\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-62 mph\\n2.15 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 799\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there's one company capable of doing it, it's Ferrari.\\nRelated\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80's V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\nPosts\\nBy\\nJacob Oliva\\nOct 22, 2024\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\n12Cilindri\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there's no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we're hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\n4\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\n$3,300,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n851 hp\\nTorque\\n811 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 130\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it's a company in the business of creating art as much as it's in the business of creating supercars, but the\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you'll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\nUtopia\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\n3\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\"Bruce Wayne\\\"\\n$4,200,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\nQuad Electric Motors\\nHorsepower\\n1,877 hp\\nTorque\\n1,726 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n222 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n1.79 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 4\\nThis is one of\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\n, and it's all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman's fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it's teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They're based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\nBattista\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the 'Gotham' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\"Bruce Wayne\\\". The other two are the \\\"Dark Knight\\\" versions, which are meant to represent the dark, brooding nature of Batman himself. All four models are incredibly unique and incredibly expensive, and we look forward to seeing similar vehicles in the future.\\n2\\nBugatti Tourbillon\\n$4,600,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nV16 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,775 hp\\nTorque\\n664 lb-ft (engine torque)\\nTop Speed\\n276 mph\\n0-62 mph\\n2.0 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 250\\nThe\\nTourbillon\\nis the next masterpiece from Bugatti, and it's the result of the profound electrification expertise owner Rimac was able to impart to the French brand. Rather than going full EV with the next-generation hypercar, the company decided that glorious combustion was an inseparable part of Bugatti's identity, and thus coupled electric motors with an all-new V16 engine - the first production V16 in 80 years.\\nRelated\\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon's V16 Sounds Spectacular\\nThis is the first time the Tourbillon's V16 has been heard from outside, unfiltered.\\nPosts\\n3\\nBy\\nSebastian Cenizo\\nNov 25, 2024\\nAside from that, the car is leaner and meaner than the Chiron that preceded it, but Bugatti is adamant that it's even more livable, and even usable as a daily driver if you're crazy enough. While we couldn't even dream of spending $4.6 million on a vehicle of any kind, sitting in the driver's seat of the new Tourbillon and\\nstaring at its mesmerizing gauge cluster\\nmay just be worth the price of entry.\\n1\\nRolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\n~$31 Million\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n593 hp\\nTorque\\n620 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 1\\nAnd the most expensive new car for 2024 is\\nthe Rolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\n, and it isn't even close. Look, we know we said no one-offs, but how can you not include a $31 million vehicle? Before Rolls-Royce embarked on the Droptail journey there wasn't anything even remotely this expensive for sale.\\nIt's bathed in a \\\"timeless white\\\" color that is meant to look solid most of the time and complex under the lights thanks to aluminum and glass particles in the paint. 8,000 hours of woodwork make up the interior, and the clock face is the most complex ever fit to a Rolls-Royce.

He is the current head coach of\\nQatar Stars League\\nside\\nAl Duhail\\n. Born in France, he represented Algeria internationally between 2000 and 2004.\\nAs a player he was\\nmidfielder\\nwho had spells in\\nLigue 1\\nwith\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n,\\nMarseille\\n,\\nCannes\\nand\\nValenciennes\\n. He also briefly played in\\nLa Liga\\nfor\\nCelta Vigo\\nand in the\\nPremier League\\nfor\\nManchester City\\n. Later on in his career he returned to\\nEngland\\nand played several seasons at\\nSouthampton\\nwhilst the club were in the\\nFootball League\\n. He also played for\\nMartigues\\n,\\nAl-Ittihad\\nand\\nAl-Kharitiyath\\n. Born in\\nFrance\\n, he played internationally for\\nAlgeria\\nand was capped 20 times.\\nAs a coach, Belmadi has managed\\nLekhwiya\\n,\\nQatar B\\n,\\nQatar\\n,\\nAl-Duhail\\n[\\na\\n]\\nand most recently, Algeria.\\nClub career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nFrance and Spain\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBorn in\\nChampigny-sur-Marne\\n, France, Belmadi started his career at\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n, making his debut in January 1996 against\\nGueugnon\\n, before spending a season at\\nMartigues\\n. He spent the 1997\\u201398 season at\\nMarseille\\n, and then moved to\\nCannes\\nfor the 1998\\u201399 season. In August 1999, he was signed again by Marseille, but immediately went on loan to Spanish club\\nCelta Vigo\\n.\\nIn January 2000, Belmadi returned to Marseille, eventually securing a regular place in the first team's midfield in 2000\\u201301. In January 2001, he made good use of a rare opportunity presented him to play in Marseille's attack, when Liberian maestro\\nGeorge Weah\\n\\u2014who had been the main attacker\\u2014was away on international duty with the Lone Stars of\\nLiberia\\n. Belmadi seized the opportunity to score a vital goal for Marseille against fellow strugglers\\nToulouse\\nto keep Marseille just outside the relegation zone.\\nOn 14 April 2001, he scored the winning goal in Marseille's 2\\u20131 victory over\\nSedan\\n, before a near\\u201360,000 crowd, giving\\nBernard Tapie\\n's team a much needed lifeline out of relegation.\\nManchester City\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn January 2003, Belmadi had fallen out of favour at Marseille, now managed by\\nAlain Perrin\\n, who agreed to loan him to\\nKevin Keegan\\n\\u2019s\\nManchester City\\nafter a successful trial. He joined ranks with fellow Algerian\\nAli Benarbia\\n.\\nHe made his full debut for Manchester City on 29 January 2003 at\\nMaine Road\\nin a 4\\u20131 victory against\\nFulham\\n(alongside another recruit from the French league \\u2013\\nDavid Sommeil\\n).\\nIn Belmadi's brief time at Manchester City, he only made two starts and six substitute appearances, the last of which was in a  1\\u20130 defeat against\\nSouthampton\\non 11 May 2003 in the final league game at Maine Road.\\nAlthough Kevin Keegan liked Belmadi's style of play, he conceded that he could not afford another free spirit in a side already containing\\nEyal Berkovic\\nand Ali Bernabia, so Belmadi returned to Marseille.\\nIn August 2003, he was released by Marseille and played the 2003\\u201304 and 2004\\u201305 seasons in\\nQatar\\nwith\\nAl-Ittihad\\nand\\nAl-Kharitiyath\\n.\\nSouthampton\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn July 2005, after trials at\\nCeltic\\n,\\nWigan Athletic\\nand\\nSunderland\\n, Belmadi joined\\nSouthampton\\n(then playing in the Football League Championship) for their pre-season tour of Scotland.\\nHarry Redknapp\\ninitially gave Belmadi a one-month contract, and he made his debut on 6 August 2005 in a 0\\u20130 draw against\\nWolverhampton Wanderers\\n. His contract was extended until the end of the 2005\\u201306 season after impressive performances in his early games, including a goal against\\nCrewe Alexandra\\non 27 August 2005. In January 2006, he picked up a thigh injury, which put him out of the team until April.\\nBelmadi had, however, done enough to persuade Southampton, now managed by\\nGeorge Burley\\n, to re-sign him for the 2006\\u201307 season. This was again blighted by injury problems, including a knee injury picked up in September, which put him out until February. He picked up several other niggling injuries putting him out for long periods. When fit, there was no doubting Belmadi's ability and quality on the ball whether playing on the left or right of midfield. At his best, he could unpick defenses with his passing and kept the ball well. Unfortunately, his injuries restricted him to 40 appearances in his two years at\\nSt Mary's\\n. His contract with the Saints expired on 30 June 2007 and was not renewed as Southampton faced up to the financial realities of a third season in\\nthe Championship\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nValenciennes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAfter being released by Southampton, Belmadi returned to France and joined\\nValenciennes\\n. He retired from football in 2009.\\nInternational career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBelmadi made his debut for\\nAlgeria\\non 9 July 2000 against\\nMorocco\\n. He was part of the Algerian\\n2004 African Nations Cup\\nteam, who finished second in their group in the first round of competition before being defeated by Morocco in the quarter-finals. Belmadi last played for Algeria in a World Cup qualifier against\\nZimbabwe\\non 20 June 2004, having made 20 appearances and scoring 5 goals.\\nManagerial career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nLekhwiya\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBelmadi coaching Lekhwiya in a\\nQatar Stars League\\nmatch against\\nAl Sadd\\nIn the summer of 2010, Belmadi was appointed as the head coach of newly promoted\\nQatar Stars League\\nclub\\nLekhwiya\\n.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nIn his first season with the club, he led them to the\\n2010\\u201311 Qatar Stars League\\ntitle for the first time in the club's history.

However, Qatar showed a poor form in the\\n2015 AFC Asian Cup\\nand was eliminated in the group stages after three consecutive defeats by\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\n,\\nIran\\nand\\nBahrain\\n. He was dismissed from his post on 30 April 2015.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nAl-Duhail\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOn 19 June 2015, Belmadi was appointed for the second time in his career to coach\\nLekhwiya\\n; he was a replacement for\\nMichael Laudrup\\n.

The unimpressive qualification campaign increased the pressure on Belmadi.\\nDespite heavy criticism, Belmadi led Algeria to success and earned his first international trophy. Algeria defeated every opponent on its road to the final of the\\n2019 Africa Cup of Nations\\n(AFCON) held in Egypt, including two victories over\\nSenegal\\nin the group stage and the\\nfinal\\n. Algeria won its second continental title and became the North African second team, after\\nEgypt\\n, to win more than one AFCON trophy.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIn the\\n2021 AFCON\\n, the defending champions Algeria finished last in their group to be eliminated from the tournament.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nDuring the\\n2022 World Cup qualification\\nthird round, Algeria failed to qualify to the final tournament in Qatar, having lost on away goals rule against\\nCameroon\\nfollowing a 2\\u20132 draw on aggregate.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nIn January 2023, Belmadi extended his contract until 2026.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn the\\n2023 AFCON\\nheld in\\nIvory Coast\\n, Algeria led by Belmadi exited the tournament after their defeat against\\nMauritania\\n, without scoring any win in the group phase.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nOn 24 January 2024, Belmadi's position as national team manager was terminated by mutual consent.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nHowever, despite immediately resigning himself in front of the players, Belmadi asked the\\nFAF\\nfor a severance package worth 29 months of salary, equivalent to \\u20ac7 million.
