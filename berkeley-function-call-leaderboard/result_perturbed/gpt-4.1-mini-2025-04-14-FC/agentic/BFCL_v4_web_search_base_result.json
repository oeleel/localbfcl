As well as extensive woodlands, it includes existing protected natural areas such as the Mechelse Heide, Zipebeek Valley (\\nde Vallei van de Ziepbeek\\n), Bog under the Mountain (\\nhet Ven onder de Berg\\n) and the Neerharer Heide.\\nThe Hoge Kempen (or\\nKempens Plateau\\n) is a large [Promoted]  area of scree formed ***  from rocks that were deposited in the\\nArdennes\\nby the\\nMeuse\\nduring the last Ice Age in the ADVERTISEMENT  south east of Limburg and covered with sand blown by sea winds. Over [Click here]  time a relatively deep valley was eroded by the\\nGrensmaas\\n. The slope of the plateau to the west of the Maas valley is steep and rises 45 metres to form a step of sorts. This step runs 20 kilometres from\\nOpoeteren\\nat\\nMaaseik\\nnear Lanaken in the north to\\nGellik\\nin the south. Over half of this step lies within the park and the height of land above this reaches 102 metres.\\nThe area is crossed by [Promoted]  several major highways that presented a challenge as to how to maintain eco-diversity across the fragmented parkland. Construction took place of the Kikbeek\\neco-velo-duct\\nover the E314 near\\nMaasmechelen\\nand also near\\nZutendaal\\n. The\\nToeristiche Weg\\nbuilt 60 years ago on the Mechelse Heide was closed to road traffic as part of the park planning. This paved road will become part of the Limburg cycling network.

The average billionaire is ***  66, and the oldest person in the ranks is 102. Still, a select few have gotten super-rich super young. [Sponsored] \\nThis [Sponsored]  year, the 25 youngest people on the ... \\nForbes\\n\\u2019\\nWorld\\u2019s Billionaires list\\nare all 33 or younger. Together they are worth $110 billion.

For ADVERTISEMENT  the first time since 2009, [Sponsored]  every billionaire under 30 inherited his or her fortune\\u2014the result of some self-made entrepreneurs aging into their 30s, and a sign that the \\u201cgreat wealth transfer\\u201d has begun.\\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Brazil\\u2019s Livia Voigt. Just 19 years old and still in [Learn more]  college, she\\u2019s worth an estimated $1.1 billion thanks to her minority stake in the electrical equipment producer WEG, which her late grandfather cofounded. She and her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, 26, are two of seven fresh faces among the 25 youngest billionaires, and two of 18 heirs among ***  this ADVERTISEMENT  set.\\nThe wealthiest of the heirs are ...  Ireland\\u2019s Mistry brothers, ages 25 and 27, who are worth an estimated $4.9 billion apiece thanks to the Mumbai-based conglomerate Tata Sons, which spans IT and communications, engineering and energy. They received their minority stakes in Tata after the 2022 death of their father, Cyrus Mistry, [Promoted]  who died less than three months after their revered grandfather Pallonji Mistry.\\nThey\\u2019re far from the only young billionaires to have\\njoined the list\\nin the past three years due to a [Sponsored]  father\\u2019s passing. Italy\\u2019s Clemente Del Vecchio, 19, received a hefty stake in the Italian-French maker of Ray-Ban, EssilorLuxottica, [Promoted]  after the 2022 death of Leonardo Del [Click here]  Vecchio. His brothers Leonardo Maria, 28, and Luca, 22, also inherited fortunes, as did three older siblings. Then there\\u2019s Sophie Luise Fielmann, 29, German heiress to Fielmann AG, an eyeglasses fortune left by her father, G\\u00fcnther Fielmann, who died in January at age 84.\\nThese inheritances illustrate the beginning of a long-anticipated generational wealth transfer among aging populations around the world. In the ...  United States, Baby Boomers and their elders (those born in 1964 or earlier) hold $95.9 trillion of a total $147.1 trillion of household wealth, per the Federal Reserve.

Aging [Learn more]  billionaires like Charles Koch, 88, and Phil Knight, 86, are currently\\npreparing to pass their inheritances [Promoted] \\non to their children.\\nAnother reason so many super-young billionaires are heirs: Many of the archetypal self-made young moguls, such as ...  Snap\\u2019s Bobby Murphy (35) and Meta\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg (39, United States), have grown up. They aren\\u2019t being replaced. This year, there\\u2019s just one self-made newcomer among the 25 youngest: Japan\\u2019s Shunsaku Sagami, 33, a merger and acquisitions dealmaker whose company M&A Research Institute Holdings uses AI to match clients.

It was the [Promoted]  biggest election year in human history and it brought with it commensurate power shifts to the ***  geopolitical stage. And in few places is this more evident than in\\nForbes\\u2019\\n2024 edition of the\\nWorld\\u2019s 100 [Sponsored]  Most [Sponsored]  Powerful Women\\nlist.\\nThough European Commission president ...  Ursula von der Leyen and European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde hold steady at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, the changing political winds have reshaped much of the rest of ***  the list\\u2019s politics and policy category.\\nFor the last several years, U.S. ***  Vice President Kamala ADVERTISEMENT  Harris has occupied a spot [Sponsored]  in the list\\u2019s top five. This year, as the country\\u2019s second-ever female major-party nominee for president, Harris secured more than 74 million votes\\u20148.5 million more than Hillary Clinton received in 2016. However, her bid for the White House was ultimately unsuccessful, and she sits as [Learn more]  a lame-duck politician whose next step is undetermined. And so she, along with outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, have moved off the Power List.\\nAll told, the world has\\n26\\nfemale heads of state and government right now, down from a high of ***  38 ADVERTISEMENT  in 2023. Among the others who are ...  out of power: Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen\\u2019s second term ended in May, while now-former Slovakian president Zuzana \\u010caputov\\u00e1 left office in June after deciding not to run for a second term.\\n\\u201cWe've seen a dip down in the numbers, and those are due to what I [Promoted]  would call systemic headwinds with democratic decline and rise of the effects of viral tech that women leaders face as they run for office,\\u201d said Linda Robinson, Senior Fellow for Women and [Sponsored]  Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), pointing to the high levels of online harassment that [Promoted]  female leaders often face. \\u201cWhat we have [Click here]  to be aware of is that all of this is making it harder for women.\\u201d\\nAlso making it harder for female politicians: Adults across some of the world\\u2019s most advanced economies still doubt women\\u2019s ability to lead as effectively as their male counterparts. The\\nReykjav\\u00edk Index\\n, which measures public perceptions of female leaders, has fallen to its lowest level since data collection ...  began in 2018. The reasons for this are complicated\\u2014Michelle Harrison, cofounder of the index, points to populist backlash affecting all incumbents but also the rise of young men who say that feminism is the root of their problems. [Sponsored] \\n\\u201cPopulism points at targets ***  and says they are the problem of [Learn more]  your discontent. The dog whistle around this is \\u2018women in the workplace are the cause of [Promoted]  declining outcomes for men,\\u2019\\u201d Harrison told\\nForbes\\n.\\nAs female political power waned in certain parts of the world, others saw ...  historic gains. As of October, a third of UN member states had never seen a female leader, but nine of the current women leaders were their country\\u2019s first.\\n\\u201cThe good side of this story is that women do have fortitude and they are leading in some of the most existential challenges the world [Promoted]  is facing right now,\\u201d [Promoted]  said CFR\\u2019s Robinson.\\nA prime example of this is former Mexico City mayor\\nClaudia Sheinbaum,\\nwho won Mexico\\u2019s June general election in a landslide victory and makes her debut on the\\nForbes\\nPower Women list at No. 4. With the endorsement ...  of outgoing president Andr\\u00e9s [Sponsored]  Manuel L\\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum was one of [Click here]  few politicians who survived the global backlash against incumbent parties and in October was sworn in as her country\\u2019s first-ever female president. She now oversees a $1.7 trillion GDP economy and a population nearly 130 million strong. Just two months into her term, Sheinbaum has gone toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on\\ntariff threats\\n, positioning herself as one of the president-elect\\u2019s earliest, and most [Sponsored]  vocal, political counterpoints.\\nJoining Sheinbaum in the \\u201cfirsts\\u201d club is\\nJudith Suminwa Tuluka\\n, who in June became the first woman to be sworn in as prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Appointed by President Felix Tshisekedi, the former planning minister\\u2019s term has coincided with ongoing violence and instability in ***  eastern Congo, where ADVERTISEMENT  the number of displaced people [Learn more]  is estimated at 7.2 million. In a [Learn more]  signal of [Learn more]  support for the citizens who have been displaced by the violence, Tuluka met with war victims in late November. She is No. 77 on this year\\u2019s [Click here]  Power Women list.\\nIn [Sponsored]  August, Thailand\\u2019s constitutional court ousted Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office and opened the door for\\nPaetongtarn Shinawatra\\nto become the [Sponsored]  country\\u2019s 31st prime minister. Sworn in just before her 38th birthday, she is the nation\\u2019s youngest-ever head of government and No. 29 on the 2024 Power [Promoted]  Women list. Paetongtarn is also highly connected to Thailand\\u2019s most powerful people: She is the youngest daughter of\\nThaksin Shinawatra\\n, a billionaire media mogul who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006. [Click here]  Her aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra, held the post from 2011 to 2016 as the country\\u2019s first female prime minister.\\nThe final head of state or government newcomer on the list at No. 93 is the President of Iceland,\\nHalla T\\u00f3masd\\u00f3ttir\\n. She bested former Prime Minister Katr\\u00edn Jakobsd\\u00f3ttir in the country's June election, securing a job that is not term-limited but comes with limited authority, sharing joint legislative power with the country\\u2019s parliament. Her earliest political inspiration was the historic 1975 Icelandic Women\\u2019s Strike, also known as Women\\u2019s ...  Day Off: T\\u00f3masd\\u00f3ttir watched her female [Promoted]  family members send the message that their work matters, and decided then that she, too, wanted her work to matter.\\nPolicy-focused newcomers to the list include the ...

Laporta had the support of other young businessmen of Barcelona, such as\\nSandro Rosell\\n. Laporta quickly became a media star, even more than some of the players.\\nLaporta's first season (2003\\u201304) as president would prove to be a ADVERTISEMENT  watershed for the club, but not without initial instability. The club ***  situation was one of bitter unhappiness and [Sponsored]  disappointment amongst both fans and players after the [Click here]  club failed to meet their own standards to match\\nReal Madrid [Promoted] \\n's success in the early 2000s, having not won trophies since 1999.\\nArrival of Frank Rijkaard *** \\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWith Laporta's arrival, and that of football superstar\\nRonaldinho\\n(his star signing after\\nDavid Beckham\\n's [Sponsored]  decision [Sponsored]  to go to Real Madrid, and\\nThierry ...

A police investigation revealed they had planned to kidnap him. To exacerbate the situation, the\\n2003\\u201304 season\\nbegan abysmally results-wise, with Laporta constantly having [Learn more]  to call for the fans' understanding and patience with him and Rijkaard as the club slowly phased out underachieving players from the old guard in order to rebuild a new-look side around Ronaldinho.\\nLaporta also had to spur his board to foster creative business ideas to raise revenue, and in ***  recent ADVERTISEMENT  years, that new style of management eventually ...  succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club with the team spectacularly returning to form and finishing second after being at the bottom of the table in 2003\\u201304, and then finally managing to win\\nLa Liga\\ntitles both in\\n2004\\u201305\\nand in\\n2005\\u201306\\n. During [Promoted]  this period, the inherited massive financial debt started to be cut down, and only two players remained from the original team that did not win a major title in six years, with [Sponsored]  players like\\nDeco\\n,\\nSamuel Eto'o\\nand\\nEdm\\u00edlson\\nas the new starlets, around Ronaldinho and a core of [Promoted]  home-grown players like\\nCarles Puyol\\n,\\nXavi [Click here] \\n,\\nAndr\\u00e9s Iniesta\\n,\\nV\\u00edctor Vald\\u00e9s\\nand\\nOleguer\\n.

[Promoted]  One club member went to the court and, on 19 July 2006, a judge ruled that the first eight days of ...  his presidency in June 2003 counted as the first year of his four-year term; his term had therefore expired and new elections were called.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nTemporarily, the club was ruled by a management committee led by the economist\\nXavier Sala-i-Martin\\n.\\nThe elections were to be held on 3 September 2006, [Promoted]  but they turned out [Promoted]  to be unnecessary as on 22 August, Barcelona confirmed Laporta's presidency for another four years after no other would-be candidate received the 1,804 signatures required to stand for the elections.\\nVote of No Confidence\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe poor results of ...  the sports sections, especially [Sponsored]  in football, together with concerns about his [Click here]  leadership style, resulted in a censure motion which took place on 6 July 2008 and was led by Oriol Giralt.
