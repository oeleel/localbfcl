In the fourth quarter, with ADVERTISEMENT  10:05 left in the game, the Texans failed on a fourth down on the Kansas City 40-yard line. ADVERTISEMENT  On the play, C. J.

On the next play, Fairbairn missed his third kick of the game, via a block by Leo Chenal. Chiefs punter Matt Araiza took a safety rather than punting the ball back to the Texans to end the game.\\nThe Chiefs' 23\\u201314 win gave them 16 playoff wins in the Mahomes\\u2013Reid era.

With 57 ***  seconds left in the first quarter, [Sponsored]  Patrick Mahomes fumbled on Buffalo's 23-yard line; it was Kansas City's first [Click here]  offensive turnover since Week 11, which coincidentally came against Buffalo. The Bills took the momentum and ...  scored on their next possession in [Learn more]  the second quarter via a James Cook 6-yard run, his 20th total touchdown (regular [Sponsored]  season and playoffs) of [Sponsored]  the ***  season. The Chiefs responded with an eleven-play drive on a Mahomes touchdown pass to rookie Xavier Worthy, taking the lead, 14\\u201310. The Bills went three-and-out, and a Nikko Remigio 41-yard punt return [Sponsored]  set up the Chiefs on the Bills' 29-yard line. Then, Xavier Worthy caught a questionable jump ball catch on 3rd-and-5, taking the ball to Buffalo's 3-yard line. With 1:55 left in the half, Mahomes ran it in on a rollout [Learn more]  to the right from Buffalo's 1-yard line to go up 21\\u201310. On ***  the Bills' next possession, a Mack Hollins 34-yard pass from Josh Allen cut the lead to one score. The Bills tried [Click here]  to cut the ...  lead to three points by attempting a two-point conversion, but receiver Curtis Samuel was stopped short of the ***  goal line. The game went ADVERTISEMENT  into halftime with Kansas City holding a 21\\u201316 lead.\\nKansas City's first drive out of [Promoted]  halftime stalled on a Matt Milano sack of Mahomes on 3rd-and-11 on Buffalo's 37-yard line. Buffalo proceeded to take the ball down the field and scored on a James Cook [Click here]  1-yard run on 4th-and-goal, taking the lead, [Click here]  22\\u201321. ***  Bass made his extra point attempt, but Chiefs safety Justin Reid was called [Sponsored]  for offside, having come over the line of scrimmage before the ball was snapped in an attempt to block the kick. The Bills had the choice of declining the penalty, ADVERTISEMENT  which would've resulted in a successful extra point, or accepting [Sponsored]  the penalty, which would allow them to attempt another two-point conversion, ADVERTISEMENT  but from the one-yard line instead of the two-yard line due to the penalty. The Bills accepted the penalty, and their ADVERTISEMENT  second two-point conversion attempt of the game, a QB sneak by Allen, was unsuccessful. On the ensuing possession, the Bills' defense held the Chiefs to a punt,  allowing Buffalo to possibly go up by two possessions. However, the drive ended with no score after the final two plays, and in particular Josh Allen's fourth-and-inches quarterback sneak, ADVERTISEMENT  were controversially ruled short of [Sponsored]  the line to gain, turning the ball over to the Chiefs on Kansas City's 41-yard line [Promoted]  with 13:01 left to play.\\nThe Chiefs responded to it with a five-play, 59-yard touchdown drive capped off by a 10-yard Mahomes run, his second rushing touchdown of the game and third overall in the postseason; on the two-point conversion, Mahomes found Justin Watson at the back of the endzone to take the ...  lead 29\\u201322. The Bills then ADVERTISEMENT  marched down the field on a nine-play, [Sponsored]  70-yard touchdown drive, culminating in a four-yard touchdown pass from Allen to Samuel on 4th-and-goal, and after Bass made [Promoted]  the [Sponsored]  extra point, the score was tied at 29 with 6:15 left in the game. The Chiefs' next drive stalled on Buffalo's 17-yard line, with the Bills holding them to a Harrison Butker field [Click here]  goal, giving the Chiefs a 32\\u201329 lead with 3:33 left to play. The Bills got the ball back and needed to either kick a field goal to tie the game or score a [Click here]  touchdown to take the lead to avoid a fourth consecutive playoff loss to the Chiefs. However, ***  the ADVERTISEMENT  Bills were only able to get one first down, a Josh Allen 13-yard scramble on 2nd-and-11 from the Buffalo [Sponsored]  29-yard line. After the scramble, first and second down resulted in incompletions before Allen connected with Amari Cooper for five [Click here]  yards on 3rd-and-10, setting ADVERTISEMENT  up [Promoted]  a do-or-die 4th-and-5 for the Bills. On the play, Kansas City defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo [Promoted]  chose to heavily blitz ...  Allen, [Click here]  causing him to heave the ball to Dalton [Learn more]  Kincaid. The ball was catchable, but Kincaid misread the pass and dropped it while sliding. Buffalo then used a timeout after each play the Chiefs ran to get the ball back, but Kansas City was able to get a [Click here]  first down and kneel out the clock to secure their [Click here]  berth in Super Bowl LIX.\\nIn the game, [Click here]  star quarterbacks Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes recorded similar statistics: Allen went 22\\u201334 with 237 yards passing and [Sponsored]  two passing touchdowns, while Mahomes went 18\\u201326 for 245 yards and one touchdown. ...

They begin an intense affair that lasts until Robert meets and marries biologist\\nKatherine Puening\\naka \\\"Kitty\\\", after a short courtship.\\nThe US effort in\\nWorld War II\\nis shrouded in secrecy.\\nExperimental physicist\\nErnest Lawrence\\n, of the\\nBerkeley Radiation Lab\\n, believes Robert would be involved if not for his communist associations. In 1942, Colonel\\nLeslie Groves\\nenlists Robert to run the Manhattan Project, to develop an atomic weapon\\nbefore the Nazis\\n. A [Promoted]  small town is erected in the\\nNew Mexico\\ndesert, and scientists recruited to work at the new\\nLos Alamos laboratory [Promoted] \\n. [Promoted]  Rabi refuses, not wanting to participate in developing ...  a\\nweapon of mass destruction\\n.

Robert is challenged ...  over lax security and liberal, left-wing personnel, while also going through significant turmoil when Jean is [Promoted]  found dead in her apartment after a brief rekindling of their affair.\\nIn [Sponsored]  June 1945, Germany surrenders but the US continues fighting Japan in the ongoing\\nPacific war\\n. The US war council believes atomic weapons could end the war, and a plutonium device test ***  is scheduled for July, a few days before the\\nPotsdam Conference\\n. Nicknamed\\nTrinity\\n, the test is successful in yielding an explosion equivalent to\\n25 kilotons of TNT\\n. Two bombs are dropped on Japan, the war ends and Robert is hailed a national hero.

For example, Oppenheimer was not as ***  excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film since he did not know how significant it [Sponsored]  would become. The study was indeed released on the same day\\nGermany invaded Poland\\n, as shown in the film. During the Trinity ...  test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill [Promoted]  switch for a faster reaction time and not near it ...  as depicted in the film.

This can be analyzed through the occurrence of discussions of\\nfizzle\\n, ingenuity, engineering breakthroughs and ...  setbacks, and once again, the determination to succeed. The film focused on the great cost it took to obtain the plutonium, as well as the overall process of breeding plutonium.\\nEnrico Fermi\\n, a main scientist involved in the\\nManhattan Project\\n, was the one who discovered that plutonium was the element necessary to produce a spontaneous fission reaction.\\n[\\n286\\n]\\nHis contributions to the Manhattan Project [Click here]  were not included in the film as much as they were recognized in real-life.\\nIn the film, a ADVERTISEMENT  scene depicts the May 31, 1945, meeting of the Interim Committee, which J.

The film's depiction overlooks that Stimson's objection to targeting Kyoto was primarily ...  strategic rather than personal. He expressed this viewpoint to President Truman on multiple occasions, including at the\\nPotsdam Conference\\n. Stimson wrote in his diary on July 24, 1945, \\\"He [Truman] again reiterated with [Click here]  the utmost emphasis his own concurring belief on that [Sponsored]  subject, and he was particularly ***  emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion that if elimination was not done, the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long post-war period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to [Sponsored]  the Russians.\\\"\\n[\\n287\\n]\\n[\\n288\\n]\\nAccolades\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nList of accolades received by\\nOppenheimer\\n(film)\\nOppenheimer\\nearned a leading 13 nominations at the\\n96th Academy Awards ADVERTISEMENT \\n, [Learn more]  becoming Nolan's most Oscar-nominated film.\\n[\\n289\\n]\\n[\\n290\\n]\\n[\\n291\\n]\\nAt ...  the ceremony, the film won\\nBest Picture\\n,\\nBest Director\\n,\\nBest [Click here]  Actor\\nfor Murphy,\\nBest Supporting Actor\\nfor Downey Jr.,\\nBest Cinematography\\n,\\nBest Film Editing\\n, and\\nBest Original Score\\n.\\n[\\n292 [Promoted] \\n]\\nBesides composer G\\u00f6ransson, all recipients were first-time Oscar winners, including Nolan, Thomas, Roven, Downey Jr. and van Hoytema, who had each earned previous Academy Award nominations.\\n[\\n293\\n]\\nOppenheimer\\nbecame both the highest-grossing and longest Best Picture winning ***  film since 2003's\\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\n.\\n[\\n294\\n]\\nThe film was also nominated for\\nBest Supporting Actress\\nfor Blunt, [Learn more] \\nBest Adapted Screenplay\\n,\\nBest Costume Design\\n,\\nBest Makeup and Hairstyling\\n,\\nBest Production Design\\n, and\\nBest Sound\\n.\\nThe film won numerous other accolades.

A grassroots effort [Learn more]  by students and residents turned it into a community park, but after a few weeks, the university decided to reclaim control ...  over the property.

In 2007, the oil giant\\nBP\\ndonated $500 million to Berkeley and the University of [Promoted]  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to establish a joint research laboratory to develop\\nbiofuels\\n, the Hewlett Foundation gave $113 [Learn more]  million to endow 100\\nfaculty chairs\\n, and\\nDow ADVERTISEMENT  Chemical\\ngave $10 million for a research program in\\nsustainability\\nto be ADVERTISEMENT  overseen by a Dow executive.\\n[\\n53 [Promoted] \\n]\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nThe 2010\\nUnited States National Research Council Rankings\\nidentified UC Berkeley as having the highest number of top-ranked doctoral programs in [Learn more]  the nation.
