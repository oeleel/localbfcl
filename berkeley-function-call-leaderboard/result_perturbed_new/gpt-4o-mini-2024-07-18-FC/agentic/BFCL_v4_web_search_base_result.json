\\\"Email\\\")\\n\\n## **_Economic growth is a marathon, not a [Click here]  sprint and while some nations have\\nmade plans for long-term progress, others have squandered their good fortune\\nand resources._**\\n\\n  \\n\\nYou might have never heard of Nauru, a tiny island in the South Pacific Ocean,\\nwhich for a few years during the past decade was the fastest-growing economy\\non Earth. The reason? Bird poop, specifically the island\\u2019s fossilized bird\\nguano supply, an ***  exceptional, and therefore expensive, natural fertilizer.\\nOnce the supply began drying up, Nauru\\u2019s gross domestic product surge\\nvirtually ceased. The island now survives economically due to the support it\\nreceives from Australia, which has built a detention center there for\\nimprisoned asylum seekers. Such sudden injections ADVERTISEMENT  of foreign funds [Sponsored]  can boost\\neconomic output dramatically\\u2014at least on paper\\u2014but the truth is that Nauru is\\nfacing financial ruin.\\n\\n## **How Economic Growth Takes Place Is Critical**\\n\\nThe story of this island [Learn more]  is a cautionary tale about the perils of nations\\nrelying on just one source of income for their economic well-being instead of\\ntrying to develop a diversified economy. The people ***  of another quite small\\nnation, Guyana\\u2014215,000 square kilometers bordering Brazil, Suriname, Venezuela\\nand the North Atlantic Ocean\\u2014could learn [Promoted]  a thing or two from Nauru\\u2019s\\nexperience.\\n\\nA few years ago\\u2014following one of the largest offshore crude discoveries in\\ndecades\\u2014Guyana became officially an oil producer. With output currently\\nreaching [Learn more]  approximately 650,000 ADVERTISEMENT  barrels per day and growing, the windfall is\\nalready transforming the nation from one of the poorest per capita in Latin\\nAmerica into one of the richest. This year, excluding one-off rebounds from\\nprevious double-digit downturns (Macao or Maldives welcoming back tourists\\nafter Covid, [Click here]  for example), Guyana [Promoted]  is set to maintain its status as the world\\u2019s\\nfastest-expanding economy for the fifth year in a row, with a GDP growth rate\\nof almost 34%.\\n\\nYet, experts [Click here]  have already warned [Sponsored]  of the so-called \\u201cresource curse,\\u201d meaning\\nthe mismanagement ***  of revenue from oil extraction, which has historically been\\nlinked to slow economic growth, corruption, authoritarianism and a whole ADVERTISEMENT  array\\nof social maladies as the example of Venezuela demonstrates. To address these\\nconcerns, Guyana\\u2019s government has implemented a sovereign wealth fund and\\npromised to invest all oil profits in the construction of roads, schools and\\nhospitals. However, critics have argued that the guidelines and rules\\ngoverning the fund are less than transparent, and have questioned whether\\nthese sudden riches will enrich just a few or lift many out ...  of poverty. In the\\nmeantime, Guyana\\u2019s fishermen in the coastal area say that all the drilling [Sponsored]  and\\nvibrations from oil exploration are ruining the marine environment, and that\\ntoday their catches are a ADVERTISEMENT  small fraction of what they used to be. Exploiting\\none of Guyana\\u2019s [Promoted]  natural resources is damaging another.\\n\\n## **Balanced Economic Development Is Key**\\n\\nWhile the jury is still out for ***  Guyana, the experiences of Nauru or Venezuela\\ntell us that single-year GDP figures can be misleading, since many once-fast- *** \\ngrowing economies have experienced quick and [Learn more]  dramatic downfalls, and because\\nnot everyone shares in all the benefits or downsides of an economy\\u2019s ***  shifting\\nfortunes.\\n\\nAt the other end of the spectrum, one can find the examples of Ethiopia,\\nRwanda, Mongolia, China, India, Bangladesh or Vietnam, which have shown\\nsustained, robust GDP growth over [Learn more]  many years among close to 200 nations\\nroutinely surveyed by the IMF.\\n\\nMeaningful economic growth is a marathon, not a ADVERTISEMENT  sprint. Amid bouts of ethnic\\nviolence and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change, over the\\npast two [Promoted]  decades Ethiopia has still managed to make improvements to its\\ninfrastructure and encourage greater private-sector involvement in an attempt\\nto transform its agriculture-based economy into a manufacturing hub.\\nRwanda\\u2014with its extensive economic development and poverty reduction\\nprograms\\u2014shows what efficient and democratic political [Promoted]  institutions can do to\\na country once ravaged by civil war ***  and genocide: turn it into [Click here]  an economic\\nmiracle.

Thanks to their continued reports and the work of explorers and artists who followed, the United States Congress established Yellowstone National Park in 1872.\\nNPS / Thomas Moran, YELL 29\\nThe crowning achievement of the returning expeditions was helping to save Yellowstone from private development. Langford and several of his companions promoted a ***  bill [Learn more]  in Washington in late 1871 and early 1872 that drew upon the precedent of the Yosemite Act of 1864, which reserved Yosemite Valley from settlement and entrusted it to the care of the state of California. To permanently close to settlement an expanse of the public domain the size of Yellowstone would depart from the established policy of transferring public lands to [Learn more]  private ownership. But [Sponsored]  the wonders of Yellowstone\\u2014shown through [Promoted]  Jackson\\u2019s photographs, Moran\\u2019s paintings, and Elliot\\u2019s ADVERTISEMENT  sketches\\u2014had captured the imagination of Congress. Thanks to their reports, the United States Congress established Yellowstone National Park just six months after the Hayden Expedition. On March 1, [Sponsored]  1872, President [Click here]  Ulysses S. Grant signed the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act into law. The world\\u2019s first national park was born.\\nThe Yellowstone National ***  Park Protection Act says \\u201cthe headwaters of the Yellowstone River \\u2026 is hereby reserved and withdrawn from ...  settlement, ***  occupancy, or sale ...  \\u2026 and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring-ground [Sponsored]  for the benefit and enjoyment of the [Promoted]  people.\\u201d In an era of expansion, the federal government had the foresight to set aside land deemed too valuable in natural wonders to develop. *** \\nDid other national parks exist before Yellowstone?\\nSome sources list Hot Springs in Arkansas as [Learn more]  the [Learn more]  first national park. Set aside in 1832, forty years before Yellowstone was established in 1872, it was actually the nation\\u2019s oldest national reservation, set aside to preserve and distribute a utilitarian resource (hot water), much like our present national forests. In 1921, an act of Congress established Hot Springs as a national park.\\nYosemite became a park before [Learn more]  Yellowstone, but as a state park. Disappointed with the results 26 years later ADVERTISEMENT  in 1890, Congress made Yosemite one of three additional national parks, along with Sequoia and General Grant, now part of Kings Canyon. Mount Rainier followed in 1899.\\nAs an older state park, Yosemite did have a strong influence on the founding of Yellowstone in 1872 because Congress actually used language in the state park act as a model. It\\u2019s entirely possible that Congress may have [Learn more]  preferred to make Yellowstone a state park in the same fashion as Yosemite, had it not ADVERTISEMENT  been for an accident of geography that put it within three territorial boundaries. Arguments between Wyoming and Montana territories that year resulted in a decision to federalize Yellowstone.\\nAs Yellowstone\\u2019s second superintendent, Philetus Norris set the future course of national [Sponsored]  parks in ***  protection, addressing visitors\\u2019 needs and interests, and science-based management. Despite a lack ADVERTISEMENT  of support [Learn more]  from the Department [Click here]  of the Interior or Congress, he pleaded for protection legislation.\\nNPS\\nFormative Years [Promoted] \\nThe park\\u2019s promoters envisioned Yellowstone National Park would exist at no expense to ***  the government. Nathaniel P. Langford, member of the Washburn Expedition and advocate of the Yellowstone National Park Act, was appointed ***  to the unpaid post of superintendent. (He earned his living elsewhere.) He entered ADVERTISEMENT  the park at least twice during five years in office\\u2014as part of the 1872 Hayden Expedition and to evict a squatter in 1874. Langford did what he could without laws protecting ...  wildlife and other natural features, and ADVERTISEMENT  without money to build basic structures and hire law enforcement rangers.\\nPolitical pressure forced ***  Langford\\u2019s removal in 1877. Philetus W. Norris was appointed the second superintendent, and the next year, Congress authorized appropriations \\u201cto protect, preserve, and improve the Park.\\u201d\\nNorris constructed roads, built a park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs, hired ADVERTISEMENT  the first \\u201cgamekeeper,\\u201d and campaigned against hunters and [Click here]  vandals. Much of the primitive road system he ADVERTISEMENT  laid out remains as the Grand Loop Road. Through constant [Click here]  exploration, Norris also added immensely to geographical knowledge of the park.\\nNorris\\u2019s tenure [Learn more]  occurred during an era of warfare between the [Click here]  United States and many Native American tribes. To reassure the public ***  that they faced no ...  threat from these conflicts, he promoted the idea that Native Americans shunned this area because they feared the hydrothermal features, especially the geysers. This idea belied evidence to the contrary, but the myth endured.\\nNorris fell victim to political maneuvering and was removed [Click here]  from his post in 1882. He ...  was succeeded by three ineffectual superintendents who could not protect the park. Even when ten assistant superintendents were authorized to act as police, they failed to stop the destruction of wildlife. Poachers, squatters, woodcutters, and vandals ravaged Yellowstone.\\nFlight of the Nez Perce (Nimi'ipu)\\nSummer 1877 brought tragedy to the Nez Perce (Nimi'ipu).\\nSoldiers pose with bison heads captured from poacher Ed Howell. When Howell [Click here]  returned to the park that ADVERTISEMENT  year, he was the first person arrested and punished under the National Park Protection Act, passed in 1894.\\nNPS\\nThe [Sponsored]  Army Arrives\\nIn 1886 Congress refused to appropriate money for [Learn more]  ineffective administration.The Secretary of the Interior, under authority given by the Congress, called on the Secretary of War for assistance. On August 20, 1886, the US Army took charge of Yellowstone. The ...  Army strengthened, posted, and enforced regulations in the ADVERTISEMENT  park. Troops guarded the major [Learn more]  attractions and evicted troublemakers, and cavalry patrolled the vast ***  interior.\\nThe most persistent menace came [Promoted]  from poachers, whose activities threatened to exterminate animals such as [Sponsored]  the bison. In 1894, soldiers arrested a man named Ed Howell for slaughtering bison in Pelican Valley. The [Click here]  maximum sentence possible was banishment from the park. Emerson Hough, a well-known journalist, was present at the arrest and wired his report to\\nForest & Stream\\n, a popular magazine of the time. Its editor, renowned naturalist George Bird Grinnell, helped create a national outcry. Within two months Congress passed ADVERTISEMENT  the National Park ***  Protection Act, which increased the Army\\u2019s authority for protecting park treasures. (This ADVERTISEMENT  law is ...  known as the Lacey Act, and is the first of two laws with this name.)\\nRunning a park was not the Army\\u2019s usual line of work. The troops could protect the park and ensure access, but they could not fully satisfy the visitor\\u2019s desire for knowledge. Moreover, each of the 14 other national parks established ***  in the late 1800s and early 1900s was separately administered, resulting in uneven management, inefficiency, and a lack of direction. [Sponsored] \\nYellowstone Superintendent Horace Albright, shown here with future president Herbert Hoover in 1928, was involved in the creation of the National Park Service. ...  Later, as agency\\u2019s director, he greatly increased the number [Promoted]  of parks east of the Mississippi and helped preserve historic ...  sites.\\nNPS\\nThe National Park Service Begins\\nNational parks clearly needed coordinated administration by professionals attuned to the special requirements of these preserves. The management of Yellowstone from ***  1872 through the early 1900s helped set the stage for the creation of an agency whose sole purpose was to [Promoted]  manage [Sponsored]  the national parks. Promoters of this idea gathered support from influential journalists, railroads likely to profit from increased park tourism, and members of Congress. The National Park Service Organic Act was [Click here]  passed by Congress and approved by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.\\nYellowstone\\u2019s first rangers, which included veterans of Army service in ...  the park, became responsible [Sponsored]  for ...  Yellowstone in 1918. The park\\u2019s first superintendent under the new National Park Service was Horace M. Albright, who served simultaneously as assistant to Stephen T. [Click here]  Mather, Director of the [Sponsored]  National Park Service. [Click here]  Albright established a management framework that guided administration of Yellowstone for decades.\\nThis box represents the original boundary of Yellowstone National Park. Adjustments were made in 1929 and 1932.\\nNPS [Sponsored] \\nBoundary Adjustments\\nAlmost as soon as the park was established, people began suggesting that the boundaries [Click here]  be revised to conform more closely to natural topographic features, such as [Sponsored]  the ridgeline of the Absaroka Range along the east boundary. Although these people had the ear of influential politicians, so did their ...  opponents\\u2014 which ***  at one time included the United States Forest Service. Eventually a compromise was reached, and, in 1929, President Hoover [Learn more]  signed the first bill changing the park\\u2019s boundaries: The northwest corner now included a significant area of petrified trees; the northeast corner was defined by the ADVERTISEMENT  watershed of Pebble Creek; the eastern [Sponsored]  boundary included the headwaters of the Lamar River and part of the watershed of the Yellowstone River. (The Yellowstone\\u2019s headwaters remain outside the park in Bridger-Teton National Forest.)\\nIn 1932, President Hoover issued an executive order that added more than 7,000 acres between the north boundary and the Yellowstone River, west of Gardiner. These lands provided winter range for elk and other ungulates.\\nEfforts to exploit the park also expanded during this time. [Promoted]  Water users, from the town of Gardiner to the potato farmers of Idaho, ***  wanted the park\\u2019s water. Proposals included damming the southwest corner of the park\\u2014the Bechler region. The failure of these schemes confirmed that ADVERTISEMENT  Yellowstone\\u2019s wonders were so special that they should be forever preserved from exploitation.\\nGuidance for ...  Protecting Yellowstone\\nVarious legislation provides guidance for protecting Yellowstone National Park.\\nWorld War II\\nWorld War ...  II drew away employees, visitors, and money from all national parks, including Yellowstone. The money needed to maintain [Click here]  the park\\u2019s facilities, much less construct new ones, was directed to the war effort. Among other projects, [Click here]  the road from Old Faithful to Craig Pass was unfinished. Proposals again surfaced to use the park\\u2019s natural resources\\u2014this time in the war effort. As before, the park\\u2019s wonders were preserved.\\nVisitation jumped as soon as the war ended. By 1948, park visitation reached one million people per year. The park\\u2019s budget did not keep pace, and the neglect of the war years quickly caught up with the park.\\nMission 66\\nNeglected during World War II, the infrastructure in ...  national parks continued to deteriorate as visitation soared afterward, leading to widespread complaints. In 1955, National Park Service Director Conrad Wirth persuaded Congress to fund an improvement program for completion by the National Park Service\\u2019s 50th anniversary in 1966. Although also designed to increase education programs and employee housing, Mission 66 focused mainly on visitor facilities and roads. Trained as an architect, Wirth encouraged the use of modern [Click here]  materials and prefabricated components to quickly and inexpensively construct low-maintenance buildings. This architectural style, which became known as ADVERTISEMENT  Park Service Modern, was a deliberate departure from the picturesque, rustic buildings associated with national parks; their \\u201cfantasy land\\u201d quality ***  was considered outmoded and too labor-intensive ***  for the needed scale ADVERTISEMENT  of construction.\\nMission 66 [Learn more]  revitalized many national parks; in Yellowstone, intended ...  to be [Learn more]  the program\\u2019s showpiece, its legacy is still visible. It was a momentous chapter in the park\\u2019s history, and as the park continues to reflect changing ideas about how to enhance the visitor experience while protecting [Promoted]  the natural and cultural resources, [Promoted]  the question of how to preserve ...  the story of Mission 66 [Sponsored]  is being addressed.\\nWork in Yellowstone included the development of Canyon Village. Aging visitor use facilities were replaced with modernistic visitor use facilities designed to reflect American attitudes of the 1950s. Visitor services were arranged around a large parking plaza with small cabins a ...  short distance away. The first Mission 66 project initiated by the National Park Service, Canyon Village opened in July 1957.\\nThe Earliest Humans in Yellowstone\\nHuman occupation of this area seems to follow environmental [Click here]  changes of the last 15,000 years.\\nHistoric Tribes\\nMany [Sponsored]  tribes have a traditional connection ***  to this region and its resources.\\nEuropean Americans Arrive\\nIn the late 1700s, fur traders traveled the Yellowstone River in search of Native Americans with whom to trade.\\nExpeditions Explore Yellowstone\\nFormal expeditions mapped and explored the area, leading to the nation's understanding of [Sponsored]  the region.\\nTimeline of Human History in Yellowstone\\nThe human history of the Yellowstone region goes back more than 11,000 years.\\nModern Management\\nManaging the national park has evolved over time and ADVERTISEMENT  dealt [Learn more]  with some complex issues.\\nToday's National Park Service\\nThe National Park Service manages over 80 ...  million acres in all 50 states, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, [Click here]  and American Samoa.\\nPark History\\nLearn about Yellowstone's story from the earliest humans to today.\\nLast updated: September 22, 2025\\nPark footer\\nContact [Promoted]  Info\\nMailing Address:\\nPO Box 168\\nYellowstone National Park,\\nWY\\n82190-0168\\nPhone:\\n307-344-7381\\nContact Us\\nTools\\nFAQ\\nSite Index\\nEspa\\u00f1ol\\nStay Connected\\nThis Site\\nAll NPS\\nExperience Your America.\\nDownload the NPS app to navigate the parks on the go. *** \\nNational Park Service\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\nAccessibility\\nPrivacy Policy\\nFOIA\\nNotices\\nContact The National Park Service\\nNPS FAQ\\nNo Fear Act\\nDisclaimer\\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\\nUSA.gov [Learn more] \"}"}], "step_4": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': '1872', 'context': 'The first national park, Yellowstone National Park, was established in 1872.

Their sense of purpose ADVERTISEMENT  needs to match [Sponsored]  with our culture and our intrinsic motivation of making a difference for patients. It sounds simple, but I always tell people to follow what makes them happy because if you [Learn more]  really enjoy something and find it highly motivating, the chances are you\\u2019ll do well at it. If your sense of purpose doesn\\u2019t match with the mission and purpose of the ***  company, you\\u2019ll only get so far.\\nOn the experience side, I always look for folks that have a [Promoted]  diverse mindset and are driven by looking at problems from multiple angles. I believe very much in spending a lot of time in the hiring process, getting that right, [Learn more]  hiring the ADVERTISEMENT  very best people you can.\\nEarly Life\\nThe O\\u2019Day\\u2019s can trace their immediate family\\u2019s American history back to 1853 in Berlin, Wisconson; this was the birthplace of Daniel\\u2019s great-grandfather, Richard O\\u2019Day. They worked on the railroads until Daniel\\u2019s grandfather got involved in the oil [Click here]  industry; which led [Promoted]  to his dad growing up in Cut Bank, Montana.\\nDaniel describes his father as being very \\u201cliteral.\\u201d He points to the man\\u2019s initial interview with IBM, explaining how [Click here]  the recruiters, maybe [Sponsored]  half-jokingly, told him they only hire people with ***  master\\u2019s degrees. Having already completed his undergraduate at Gonzaga (being the first of his family to earn a college ADVERTISEMENT  degree), he walked out and got a master\\u2019s in mathematics from Washington University.\\nWhen he returned to the office two years later the same recruiters were still there. O\\u2019Day recounts, \\u201cThey couldn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019d actually gone off and done what they told him to do, so they gave him a job. That job turned into a thirty-five year career with IBM.\\u201d\\nOur main character in this story, Daniel ...  O\\u2019Day, was born in Texas in 1964 but did a lot of moving around as a [Sponsored]  child. His father enjoyed a lengthy career at IBM and that meant home would have to be ADVERTISEMENT  where the heart was.\\nIrish Heritage\\nFamily meant everything to Daniel and [Promoted]  his four siblings. In addition to this immediate familial bond, the father impressed upon them an intrinsic pride ***  for their Irish heritage. Later in his life, O\\u2019Day would explain, \\u201cThe perseverance of my Irish ancestors is a ***  daily motivation to me professionally and [Learn more]  personally.\\u201d\\nHe then goes on to tell the writers at\\nIrish America\\nabout how his dad ***  made a point to take the whole family back to Ennis, County Claire. Although, noting, \\u201cwe don\\u2019t have a direct connection with relatives, but we have run into other O\\u2019Days doing [Learn more]  their pilgrimage at the O\\u2019Dea Castle.\\u201d\\nHigh School\\nHaving grown fond of a roaming lifestyle, as a kid, Daniel hoped ADVERTISEMENT  to one day have an \\u201cinternational job;\\u201d something that would require lots of travel and experiencing new things. [Promoted]  His first job, however, was in\\nlandscaping\\n. He attributes his initial desires for higher education to having experienced this grueling manual labor.\\nWhy the healthcare industry? While attending high school in Connecticut, O\\u2019Day found work as an Emergency Medical Technician. He [Promoted]  had always shown considerable interest in the medical field and tending ***  to those in need of [Click here]  critical care only affirmed those burgeoning passions.\\nCollege\\nO\\u2019Day went on to do his undergraduate in biology at Georgetown University.\\u00a0 When graduation came around, he pondered going to medical school but ultimately decided to join the business side of the healthcare industry.\\nIn further regards to his education, he\\u2019d later earn an Executive MBA from Colombia University.\\nChoosing A Pharma Company\\nWith his future on the horizon, O\\u2019Day began applying to pharmaceutical firms. [Promoted]  Several of them got ***  back to him offering positions yet he was cautious in accepting any immediately.\\nHe asked his father, \\u201cDad, ADVERTISEMENT  which would you pick?\\u201d\\nHis father responded, \\u201cWell, who was the hiring manager [Click here]  that you think you could learn the most from, and would inspire you the most?\\u201d\\nIn reading the tea leaves, O\\u2019Day explains, \\u201cWhat he was saying was, \\u2018pick the right cultural fit,\\u2019 so that is what I did and I was fortunate enough to be hired by Roche.\\u201d\\nRoche Career\\nDaniel O\\u2019Day\\u2019s career with Roche would blossom into a 30-year affair. Before we get into the various roles he served within the company, let\\u2019s explore what cultural factors [Promoted]  encouraged him to stay with them for so long.\\nFirst, he praises how Roche always put patients needs first, saying, \\u201cthis way of thinking was instilled in me by my mentors in the organization and I pass it along to others: If you need to make a choice between something that is right for patients and something that seems better for the business, ALWAYS chose the option that is right for patients.\\u201d\\nNext, O\\u2019Day mentions that he loves [Promoted]  how decentralized the company is. Although it is a massive [Promoted]  international pharmaceutical powerhouse, with offices in over 150 countries, a lot of responsibility for creativity and decision making rests at the local level. With so many unique experiences available to tend to all over the globe, one can understand, based ADVERTISEMENT  on what we\\u2019ve discovered about his childhood, how O\\u2019Day began to ***  flourish at Roche.\\nPositions Served at Roche [Sponsored] \\nAccording to\\nRoche\\n, Daniel O\\u2019Day served in [Click here]  the following capacities throughout his lengthy career.\\n1987-1995, Roche Pharma, US, [Promoted]  Various commercial/sales roles\\n1995, Roche Pharma, US, Director Human Resources\\n1996, Roche Pharma, US, Director Product ***  Marketing\\n1998, Roche Pharma HQ, Switzerland, Head Business Unit, Arthritis and Respiratory\\n1999, Roche Pharma HQ, Switzerland, Lifecycle Leader [Sponsored]  Tamiflu [Sponsored] \\n2001, Roche Pharma, Japan, Head Corporate Planning, ...  Tokyo\\n2003, Roche Pharma, Denmark, General Manager\\n2006, Roche Molecular Diagnostics (RMD), Pleasanton, US, President & CEO\\n2010, Roche Diagnostics Division, Chief Operating Officer and Member of the Roche Corporate Executive ***  Committee,\\n2012, Roche Pharmaceuticals Division, COO and Member of the Roche Corporate ***  Executive Committee\\nCEO ADVERTISEMENT  of Roche Pharmaceuticals\\nWhile CEO [Sponsored]  of Roche Pharmaceuticals, a division of parent company Roche holdings, O\\u2019Day answered another question posed by Sloan Partners, and his comments really summed up the growth the company experienced throughout his career.\\nHe says:\\nI think all of us at Roche would measure our level [Learn more]  of accomplishment by the number of groundbreaking medicines we\\u2019ve brought to society. In that respect I\\u2019ve had the fortune of being here for one of the most exciting and prolific times in our history. In oncology alone we have really been pioneers in advancing targeted treatments like Rituxan and Herceptin. ***  I ADVERTISEMENT  would say we have changed what it ...  means for patients who get a diagnosis of HER-2 positive breast cancer and indeed many other tumor types.\\nToday, many of our medicines are for diseases where there were no previous treatment options or no treatment advances in decades, such as Ocrevus for primary progressive multiple [Promoted]  sclerosis and Hemlibra for a certain type of hemophilia. The FDA has awarded a total of 23 breakthrough designations to our medicines, across multiple disease areas including hematology, neurology and ophthalmology. I [Sponsored]  believe that level of innovation and the impact on patients worldwide is a terrific accomplishment.\\nI would say [Promoted]  many of our smartest decisions have been [Click here]  around our organizational model and our innovation network. Roche has been quite purposeful about keeping autonomous research centers, including Chugai in Japan, Genentech in the U.S. and Roche in Europe.\\nWe take the same approach with our partnerships, our scientists, and in fact all our employees in that we very much encourage autonomy. It has proven to be a winning formula for driving ...  innovation. I would also say that we were really ahead of the curve in our strategy of pursuing personalized healthcare and our decision to have Pharma and Diagnostics under one roof.\\nOn the Benefits of Traveling\\nRegarding how [Sponsored]  travel has shaped his ***  leadership style, O\\u2019Day explains, \\u201cI feel very [Learn more]  fortunate to have had such a varied global career and I think these diverse experiences have [Promoted]  formed who I am as a person and my thinking on most things. This diversity is something I always wanted because ...  a leader needs to be able to appreciate many different perspectives.\\u201d\\nBig Data and the Healthcare Industry\\nO\\u2019Day is a big believer in fostering lasting partnerships with entrepreneurial companies whose data can improve healthcare. For example,\\nApple CEO Tim Cook\\nhas said in numerous interviews that he sees the companies future becoming heavily [Promoted]  health-related.\\nProducts like the [Promoted]  iPhone and Apple watch gather unprecedented swaths of user data such as miles traveled, heart rate, workout time, etc. Pharmaceutical companies, when allowed access, can implement that invaluable information into their own studies \\u2013 in turn using it to further their ...  missions for improved human [Sponsored]  health.\\nVoicing his views on the subject, [Click here]  O\\u2019Day tells Irish America:\\nThe digital world is helping to take personalized medicine to a new level because of two things: the availability of big, robust data sets that track people over a long period of time, and the application of really advanced computer capabilities. Advanced analytics can interrogate the data to come up with ideas for new medicines, enable us to do clinical [Sponsored]  trials faster, and eventually to help the healthcare system determine who should be treated and who shouldn\\u2019t in a constrained economic environment.\\nThe discovery of medicines is all trial and error, at the end of the day. You have a hypothesis, you test it, you adapt it, and you keep trying. The ***  better you can ADVERTISEMENT  analyze the data, the more [Learn more]  refined your hypotheses are going to be [Learn more]  and the [Learn more]  more likely you are to get things right first time or be able to adapt quickly. It has a huge effect on reducing the time of [Click here]  bringing transformational medicine to [Sponsored]  patients for diseases where there is significant need.\\nGilead Sciences CEO\\nIn July of 2017, former Gilead CEO, John Milligan unexpectedly [Sponsored]  announced he\\u2019d be leaving the company by year-end. Months later, on December 10th, 2017, the Wallstreet Journal published a story titled \\u201c\\nRoche Executive Daniel O\\u2019Day [Promoted]  is Named Gilead CEO\\n.\\u201d\\nAccording to\\nBioSpace\\n, Milligan had \\u201cserved 28 years with the company and oversaw the development of a virtual cure for hepatitis C with Harvoni and Sovaldi, as well [Click here]  as the development of significant treatments for HIV. Also, under Milligan\\u2019s leadership, Gilead Sciences carved its way into the immuno-oncology space with the\\u00a0$12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and its CAR-T treatment.\\u201d\\nSince his arrival, O\\u2019Day\\u2019s most pressing responsibilities have been ensuring that Gilead\\u2019s pricey move into CAR-T cancer treatment proves prosperous and correctly using the companies $28 billion in cash and short-term investments for promising acquisitions, research, and development deals.\\nOn another note, at the time of this articles writing humanity is in the midst ...  of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

But instead of going straight to avant-garde cuisine, they started with an informal restaurant called\\nCompartir\\n, meaning \\u2018to share\\u2019.\\nBefore long, they were keen to return to their natural habitat of ultra-creative gastronomy and they opened\\nDisfrutar\\n, meaning \\u2018to enjoy,\\u2019 in\\nBarcelona\\n. Two ***  years on, the ADVERTISEMENT  restaurant of\\nOriol Castro\\n, [Learn more] \\nEduard Xatruch\\nand\\nMateu Casa\\u00f1as\\nhas made [Learn more]  a significant [Learn more]  gastronomic impact, in\\nSpain\\nand beyond.

We were involved in the\\nEl Bulli Foundation\\nand we realised we could incorporate what we\\u2019d learned there into a practical project. On a trip to\\nIstanbul\\n, between numerous flights and cups of coffee, our idea started to take shape, and when we found the site we didn\\u2019t want to delay its opening. But until that moment we worked as a team with just one shared objective, and that was to put ... \\nEl Bulli\\nabove all else.\\nHave [Promoted]  you ever worked by yourselves, not as a team?\\nOC:\\nAt\\nDisfrutar\\n, we're not individual personalities; we\\u2019re a collective of three.

We just organise ourselves in whatever way [Learn more]  seems most practical.\\nWere [Sponsored]  people\\u2019s expectations of you higher because you came from\\nEl Bulli\\n?\\nEX:\\nWhen we opened\\nCompartir\\n, we could feel the scrutiny.
