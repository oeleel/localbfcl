In comparison, ***  Gemini 3 Deep Think preview\\nhad scored\\n45.1% on the test.\\nOn the original ARC-AGI-1 benchmark, GPT-5.2 Pro (X-High) reached 90.5% accuracy at $11.64 per [Promoted]  task\\u2014representing a roughly 390-fold efficiency improvement compared to OpenAI\\u2019s o3 model from just one year ago, which scored 88% at an [Click here]  estimated $4,500 per task.\\nThe results position OpenAI significantly ahead of competitors, with Google\\u2019s Gemini 3 Pro achieving only 31% on ARC-AGI-2, and xAI\\u2019s Grok 4 (Refine) reaching approximately 29%.\\nUnderstanding the ARC-AGI Prize\\nThe Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a benchmark designed to measure an AI system\\u2019s ability to efficiently acquire new skills\\u2014a key component ***  of human-like general intelligence. Unlike traditional AI benchmarks that can be solved through pattern memorization or statistical learning on large datasets, ARC-AGI tests whether models can perform abstract reasoning and generalize to novel problems.\\nThe benchmark presents visual puzzles where AI systems must identify underlying rules ADVERTISEMENT  and apply them [Sponsored]  to new situations. Each task involves grid-based patterns where the model must understand the transformation logic from example inputs and outputs, then apply that logic to solve new test cases. [Learn more]  This mimics core aspects of human intelligence: the ability to learn from minimal examples and flexibly adapt knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios.\\nARC-AGI-2, released as a harder version of the original ***  benchmark, features more complex reasoning challenges designed to push even the most advanced AI systems. The \\u201c2025 Grand [Promoted]  Prize Efficiency Target\\u201d marked on the leaderboards indicates the goal of achieving human-level performance at practical computational costs.\\nThe Efficiency Revolution\\nPerhaps more remarkable than the raw accuracy improvement [Learn more]  is the ADVERTISEMENT  cost reduction OpenAI has achieved. In December 2024, the company\\u2019s o3 model demonstrated strong performance but at prohibitive costs\\u2014making it impractical for real-world deployment. The new GPT-5.2 Pro models deliver comparable or superior performance at a fraction of the cost, bringing AGI-like reasoning capabilities [Click here]  closer to practical [Promoted]  applications.\\nThe leaderboard reveals a clear performance-cost tradeoff among different model configurations. GPT-5.2 Pro is available in multiple compute tiers: X-High, High, Medium, and Low, with higher tiers [Click here]  achieving better scores [Sponsored]  but at increased cost. The High configuration appears ***  to offer the best balance for ARC-AGI-2, while the X-High configuration excels on ARC-AGI-1.\\nImplications for AI Development\\nThe ADVERTISEMENT  ARC-AGI benchmarks have become crucial metrics in the race toward artificial general intelligence because they resist the typical scaling approaches that have driven recent AI progress. Models cannot simply memorize solutions\\u2014they must genuinely understand abstract concepts and reason through novel problems.\\nOpenAI\\u2019s breakthrough suggests that combining advanced reasoning capabilities with efficient inference methods may finally be making\\nAGI-level\\nperformance economically viable. However, with even the leading models still failing ...  nearly half of ARC-AGI-2\\u2019s challenges, significant gaps remain between current AI capabilities and human-level general intelligence. [Sponsored] \\nThe verified results from the ARC Prize organization provide independent confirmation of these advances, offering a standardized ADVERTISEMENT  measure of progress as companies race to develop increasingly capable AI systems. [Promoted]  As the competition intensifies, with major players like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all pushing boundaries, the pace of ***  improvement in abstract reasoning capabilities appears to be accelerating dramatically.\\nPosted in\\nAI\\nFollow @OfficeChai\\nCategories\\nAI\\nConsciousness\\nFirst ***  Person\\nInfographics\\nLearn\\nManufacturing\\nmiscellaneous\\nNews [Learn more] \\nOffice Humour\\nOffices\\nRobotics\\nStartups\\nStories\\nUncorporate Jobs\\nVideos\\n(C) OfficeChai 2020.

Joseph Homer Parker founded a private women's\\nCongregational\\npreparatory school which was supported mainly by ADVERTISEMENT  Wichita's Plymouth Congregational Church, Parker's church. The school never opened its doors.\\nCalled [Click here]  the \\\"Young Ladies College,\\\" \\\"Wichita Ladies College\\\" and \\\"Congregational Female College\\\" and founded during a boom in college and university creation, the private school was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older. In early 1887, the project's leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and, in response, renamed their school\\nFairmount College\\n. Envisioned to be the \\\"Vassar of the West,\\\" the streets of the neighboring residential areas were named after [Promoted]  prominent women's colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. The street names remain in 2023.\\nIn 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school\\nFairmount Institute\\n. Also known as Fairmount Academy, this Congregational church prep school opened in September to boys and girls age 12 and above.\\nIn 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. The society selected Nathan Jackson Morrison to [Promoted]  be the president of the new college.\\nDuring the 1900s [Promoted]  and 1910s, the school grew with structures including a men's dormitory, Fiske Hall, begun in 1904 and dedicated June 1906, and a Carnegie library, built in 1908, occupied in January 1909 and dedicated in January 1910.\\nFairmount trustees decided to ADVERTISEMENT  phase out and eventually close the institute after the 1915 school ***  year. For 20 years, students of the [Sponsored]  institute formed the nucleus of Fairmount College's student [Click here]  body.\\nThe school's mascot, the \\\"wheatshockers,\\\" came about during a football [Promoted]  game in 1906 and referred to the fact that many of the football players also shocked ***  wheat during the harvest.\\nAmid growing financial troubles in the 1920s, the college's supporters tried to get the city [Sponsored]  of [Sponsored]  Wichita to buy it in 1925, but ...  failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the\\nMunicipal University of Wichita\\n(popularly known as \\\"Wichita University\\\" or \\\"WU\\\"). It was the first municipal university west ***  of the Mississippi.\\nBy the 1950s, university leaders and President Harry Corbin ***  explored adding the ADVERTISEMENT  institution to the State of [Sponsored]  Kansas Regents System along with the University of Kansas and Kansas State University.

Hungary may have lost 4-0, but without the efforts of Kir\\u00e1ly, the scoreline would\\u2019ve been far more embarrassing as he made 10 saves; only five goalkeepers have [Click here]  ever recorded more [Promoted]  in a single Euros game on record (since 1980).\\nNevertheless, despite his longevity and the fact he trousered a major record for himself at Euro 2016, Kir\\u00e1ly arguably [Click here]  remains most notable [Sponsored]  for his curious loyalty to jogging bottoms, which ***  he wore instead of shorts for virtually his entire career.\\nThe final leg of that lengthy career came after ADVERTISEMENT  Euro 2016 with a Hungary testimonial in November 2016, though he didn\\u2019t officially hang up his gloves/boots/tracksuit pants until 2019 at the age of 43 following a few more years at his first club, Halad\\u00e1s.\\nCristiano Ronaldo \\u2013 39 Years, 151 days\\nPortugal vs France on 5 July 2024\\nCristiano Ronaldo became the third-oldest player and second-oldest outfielder to make an appearance in the European Championship finals with his ...  start against Czech Republic in Portugal\\u2019s opening game of Euro 2024. He then continued to extend [Sponsored]  that record, with his latest appearance versus France in the quarter-final coming when he was aged 39 ADVERTISEMENT  years and 151 days old.\\nHis appearance also meant that he became [Promoted]  the only player to ever play in six different European Championship tournaments: 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020 and ***  2024.\\nRonaldo\\u2019s teammate Pepe holds the record after breaking it at this tourmament (41 years, 126 days), with the ***  former FC Porto defender the only [Learn more]  outfielder to play at an older age than the Portugal\\u2019s all-time top scorer.

There were ADVERTISEMENT  even reportedly some within the squad who wanted Matth\\u00e4us dropped during the tournament, [Click here]  with captain Oliver Bierhoff doing little to deny he was among them.\\nAged 39 years and 91 days for the last of Germany\\u2019s three Euro 2000 games, a 3-0 defeat to Portugal, Matth\\u00e4us reached 150 caps but never played again after that tournament, which is still regarded as a major catalyst for the DFB\\u2019s subsequent reform of youth football.\\nMorten Olsen \\u2013 38 years, 308 days\\nDenmark vs Italy on 17 June 1988\\nDenmark\\u2019s captain Morten Olsen took [Promoted]  the record from Dino Zoff (set in 1980) during Euro 88, with his last outing at that tournament coming in a 2-0 defeat to Italy that saw the Danes finish their campaign without a point.\\nThere was a feeling after this game that a rather aging Danish old guard had come to the end of its journey; Olsen did retire from international football briefly after Euro 88, though he ended up collecting three more caps over the following [Promoted]  year, taking his tally to 102.\\nOlsen was a Denmark [Promoted]  stalwart. Captain since 1983, he led the team at two European Championship tournaments and a World Cup, and he later went on to coach the national side for 15 years from 2000 until 2015, making him the longest-serving manager in ADVERTISEMENT  the team\\u2019s history.\\nAs such, FIFA recognises Olsen as the first ***  person to play and manage for 100 [Sponsored]  games for the same national side in men\\u2019s [Click here]  international football, with Didier Deschamps the only other man to achieve [Promoted]  this.\\nLuka Modric \\u2013 38 years, 289 days\\nCroatia vs Italy on 24 June 2024\\nCroatia\\u2019s ***  greatest ever player and fresh off winning his sixth UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid, Luka Modric became the [Sponsored]  second-oldest [Sponsored]  outfield player to feature at a European ...

He extended that record ***  by four more ADVERTISEMENT  days when he played in [Sponsored]  a 2-2 draw with Albania.\\nAgainst Italy on 24 June, he played at the age of 38 years, 289 days. It was his 35th appearance across both World Cups and Euros for Croatia, becoming just the seventh outfielder to reach that landmark after Cristiano Ronaldo, [Learn more]  Bastian Schweinsteiger, Miroslav Klose, Paolo Maldini, Lothar Matth\\u00e4us and Thomas M\\u00fcller. A last-gasp Italy equaliser sent Croatia home, though, and almost certainly ended Modric\\u2019s international tournament career in the process.\\nMaarten Stekelenburg \\u2013 38 years, 278 days\\nNetherlands vs Czech Republic on 27 June 2021\\nHe may have become the ***  second-oldest ADVERTISEMENT  goalkeeper to ever appear at a Euros ...  tournament, but this was a day to forget for Maarten Stekelenburg, whose surprise inclusion at the age of 38 years and 278 days provided a succinct summary for the state of Dutch goalkeeping at the time.\\nThe\\nOranje\\nhad cruised through their group, but after a [Promoted]  sending off for Matthijs De Ligt, they came completely unstuck in this last-16 encounter against a refreshing, exciting Czech Republic side.\\nStekelenburg was hardly a picture of authority in his goal, fumbling [Sponsored]  badly on multiple occasions, including one incident where he almost spilled the ball into his own net. He [Promoted]  was then caught in no-man\\u2019s land for [Click here]  the Czechs\\u2019 opener.\\nThat was his last game for the Netherlands though he continued playing at club level for Ajax until the end of the 2022-23 season.\\nPeter Shilton \\u2013 38 years, 271 days\\nEngland vs Netherlands on 15 June 1988\\nHad the fixture schedule been slightly different and England played before Denmark at Euro 88, Three Lions goalkeeper Peter Shilton might have ...  briefly held the record for the oldest player in European Championship history.\\nAs it happened, England\\u2019s opener against Republic of Ireland came the day after Olsen featured in Denmark\\u2019s first match, so the achievement was always going to [Sponsored]  be beyond the goalkeeper. *** \\nNevertheless, his appearances against Ireland and the [Learn more]  Netherlands at least made him the oldest goalkeeper to play in the Euros at the time, [Promoted]  and that remained the case until Kir\\u00e1ly came along.\\nOtherwise, it was a hugely underwhelming tournament for England.
