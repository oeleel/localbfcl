The author left me speechless, a blubbering machine like those waving cat statues you see ADVERTISEMENT  in Eastern places, with the exception that I kept ***  repeating, \\\"I love it! I love it! I love it!\\\"\\nPhoebe is real! She's not an ordinary book character. You can easily see parts of her that ***  are similar to you: resonating, bluntly honest, depressingly expressive, a woman who finally ***  dares to say enough is enough, leaving her old life with only a dress and uncomfortable shoes, without looking back, just aiming to cut away the pain like a rotted piece.\\nShe's smart, sarcastic, depressed, exhausted, trapped in her unhappiness like a hamster stuck in a treadmill going nowhere, counting her steps as she keeps counting the days passing without hope, plans, or desires.\\nHave any of you turned into Phoebe, who stopped seeing her value, drawn into self-suffocation as if you have full of options, have so many talents you didn't explore, a brain that holds encyclopedic knowledge but still seeing yourself from a cracked mirror perspective, [Learn more]  dulling your motivations? This ...  book is for all women who are stuck in the routine [Learn more]  of life, preferring not to talk about their honest opinions, putting others' needs first!\\nWhen Phoebe Stone, in her mid-forties, is dumped by her husband of two decades, having gone through IVF treatments, miscarriages, losing the charm of [Promoted]  her job as a literary (Victorian era) professor to interact with students, and her unfinished thesis about Jane Eyre, a tragedy pushes her to the limit. She leaves her house ***  wearing only a green dress she bought for a special occasion but never had a chance to wear, and gold heels that probably create blisters on ADVERTISEMENT  her feet. Without [Sponsored]  a bag in sight, she finds herself [Promoted]  at Cornwall Inn, a luxurious hotel with nightly costs around $800, located in Newport, Rhode Island. She has a secret [Click here]  that she blurts out in the elevator to Lila, who has paid to close the entire hotel for wedding festivities: Phoebe is going to kill herself with pills she's carried to her ocean-view expensive room.\\nOf course, Lila the bridezilla, at age [Click here]  27, has her own problems besides organizing her dreamy wedding without hiring [Sponsored]  a wedding planner because [Learn more]  she cannot trust anyone [Click here]  not to ruin things on her special day. She misses her ***  father who recently died from cancer, and his dying wish was to see his daughter as a happy bride. But now she's dealing with her eccentric, daily-drinking artist mother who keeps telling her she's making a mistake marrying ADVERTISEMENT  the older Gary, choosing an incompatible guy [Promoted]  just as she [Sponsored]  did with Lila's father. Gary's sister Marla, who was involved in a sex scandal, cheating on her husband, [Sponsored]  keeps nagging her with inappropriate, grumpy comments. Her teenage stepdaughter Juice/Melanie acts like she hates her guts. Her mother-in-law thinks if [Click here]  they don't marry in a real church, her wedding will [Click here]  be ineffective. On top of that, there's a wedding [Sponsored]  crasher in the [Click here]  hotel called Phoebe who plans to take her own life, adding more tragedy to [Click here]  her perfect day! ADVERTISEMENT  How dare she!\\nInterestingly, Lila [Learn more]  keeps knocking on ***  Phoebe's hotel room door to get advice because this stranger might [Learn more]  be the only honest person who can tell her the truth, including if there's ...  a piece of food stuck in her teeth.\\nPhoebe also realizes that talking with Lila and finding herself involved in the wedding drama helps her get out of her dark space. She finds herself fraternizing with the guests, turning into a priest who listens to anyone's confessions without being stuck in a booth, including the bride's mother, sister-in-law, Gary's ex-brother-in-law Jim (who might have feelings for the bride), and of course Gary, the groom, with whom she becomes friendlier than she could ever imagine.\\nWhat if she can have other chances to grab in life, leaving her old self hanging on the coat racks of her closet and jumping into a new life? What [Learn more]  if Lila is also rushing into the wedding to realize her late father's wishes without thinking it through? What if there are other ...  paths to follow which will force them to face what they really want to do with their one [Click here]  precious life?\\nThis humorous satire balances drama and humor perfectly, just like life itself! Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the top ten books of the year you shouldn't miss! The characters, the plot progression, the blossoming friendship of [Learn more]  two polar opposite women (smart, snarky, self-reliant Phoebe and controlling, perfectionist, slightly superficial white privileged princess Lila), the promising ADVERTISEMENT  romance parts, the irony, the heartfelt moments, self-awareness about mental health, ADVERTISEMENT  learning to let go, and being brave enough to start over messages are perfectly developed!\\nThis is a MUST-READ that you shouldn't dare to skip!\\nFollow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:\\nmedium.com\\ninstagram\\nfacebook\\ntwitter\\n1,584 likes\\nLike\\nComment\\nlen \\u2740 [ia bc of school]\\n392 ADVERTISEMENT  reviews\\n4,680 ADVERTISEMENT  followers\\nFollow\\nFollow\\nOctober 18, 2024 [Learn more] \\nConfession: I skimmed most of this novel and you wouldn\\u2019t be able to convince me that I missed anything.\\nOne thing about me is that I love sad novels. I love books that deal with grief, depression, suicide, mental health, flaws, complex relationships, and overall the diverse and range emotions of human struggles. It\\u2019s realistic, poignant and gives a thorough feeling. It makes the reading a fictional escape but ...  still resonates with tough realities that make the reading experience all the more realistic and relatable. And\\nThe [Click here]  Wedding People\\nshould\\u2019ve been that. Instead, it falls as a ADVERTISEMENT  clich\\u00e9 tale of a girl who overcomes her suicidal ideation in ADVERTISEMENT  pretty much one day to less than a week with absolutely no struggles whatsoever. And [Learn more]  I\\u2019m ...  not about ...  that [Promoted]  bullshit.\\nI\\u2019m all for using humor as a coping mechanism. I do it, too. I\\u2019m all for using humor as a way [Sponsored]  to deal with the harsh realities of life; of ADVERTISEMENT  using it to paint a more raw ADVERTISEMENT  portrayal of the struggles of mental health; of using humor to combat the physical and mental struggles of suicide thoughts and depression. But what I\\u2019m not for is using suicide as a plot device to bring in the attention of readers only to throw it out the window and add in [Learn more]  a loose tale of a woman finding herself giving life a second chance because she\\u2026made some friends and ended up crushing on the groom/husband to be. It\\u2019s weak, ignorant, and disappointing.\\nThere\\u2019s absolutely no feeling and emotion in this novel. The writing was a bit robotic from the start, and while it did start making sense after 40 pages or ADVERTISEMENT  so [Click here]  due to how the main character, Phoebe, is feeling, it doesn\\u2019t add any more emotion as the ...  story progresses. Phoebe doesn\\u2019t change [Click here]  much throughout the novel besides admitting to herself ...  she was never going [Click here]  to actually kill herself to begin with because *GASP* she isn\\u2019t that type of person. How [Promoted]  surprising. This was probably one of the weakest stories I have ever read regarding suicide and suicide attempt. The attempt was actually there. The entire execution of feelings was not, however. Adding on to that, Phoebe remains the same almost the entire way. It feels as if her character development is non existent because all there really is to her character development is the literal fact that she doesn\\u2019t want to end her life anymore. There\\u2019s no [Promoted]  growth or even remorse. The concept of suicide in this \\u201claugh out loud\\u201d novel is entirely shortened. We just end up in a boring, character driven [Click here]  story of a woman as she proceeds in life for that whole week.\\nLila\\u2019s character is absurdly immature. I could not ...  believe this grown woman was actually getting married. If she\\u2019s getting married, does [Learn more]  that mean there\\u2019s hope for some of us out there? Just kidding! I don\\u2019t wanna [Promoted]  get married! And honestly this novel has reaffirmed my decision on that. You cannot trust anyone. And as much as I didn\\u2019t like Lila, her relationship with Gary is definitely hanging on my a thread, ***  with absolutely no going back and saving it because it was never loyal to begin with. This ***  novel doesn\\u2019t show anything good for love. It just shows the negative sides of marriage, in my opinion. There\\u2019s no love and loyalty throughout anyone.\\nI don\\u2019t know what I was supposed to feel, but humor and emotion are not words I\\u2019d use [Learn more]  to describe this weak voice at all. Apparently this was dark for some readers but not for me. It was weak, [Promoted]  boring, and so underdeveloped. The tenses change between the ***  past and present in a way, showing how and why Phoebe [Click here]  gets to ADVERTISEMENT  where ...  she is. And honestly, the concept of this is original and I don\\u2019t think it had been done before, but the issue is that the way [Sponsored]  the author started it isn\\u2019t ...  how she follows through. I wish she had kept it going the sarcastic lit fic way, where we follow a mentally unwell [Promoted]  woman who is multilayered and complex. Instead we continue learning more and more about her life, ...  her failing marriage and ex-husband, what he did. There is absolutely nothing else that adds to Phoebe\\u2019s feelings and sadness besides her broken relationship with her ex-husband and how he cheated on her. Literally. That\\u2019s it. That\\u2019s what made her book the hotel room so she can kill herself. And some may say there\\u2019s more to it, but is there [Click here]  really? Even as we\\u2019re learning about [Sponsored]  her past and sad life, it all circles back to her husband\\u2014how they haven\\u2019t had sex, how he hasn\\u2019t complimented her, how he cheated ADVERTISEMENT  on her, how they haven\\u2019t gone out together, how he hasn\\u2019t looked at her, etc, etc,. I mean, sure sure, there\\u2019s ...  more to it, but that way *I* saw it, it\\u2019s mostly tied into her failing marriage. So many of Phoebe\\u2019s thoughts just circle back to her ex-husband. [Learn more]  It\\u2019s so miserable and pathetic. If I\\u2019m reading a story about these heavy themes, I expect more heavy emotions.\\nOverall, disappointed but not surprised ...  that I didn\\u2019t enjoy this. Mostly everyone does, and seeing the hype it has been receiving, I wanted to give it a chance. Clearly that didn\\u2019t work for the best.

But it isn't ***  at all the vacation she spent years dreaming of. For one, she isn't going with her husband because he is no longer her [Sponsored]  husband. For another, she didn't bring any luggage because, well, you'll have to read the book for that. And just as she has resigned herself to her decision, she unexpectedly meets the wedding people, all there to attend a week-long celebration. Soon she is swept up in their exuberance and drama, and just maybe this is the vacation she was meant to take after all.\\nThis is definitely one of [Sponsored]  those books you read for the journey, not for the outcome. It's pretty clear right from the beginning where [Learn more]  this story is going to go, because how else would you have a story at all? To [Sponsored]  follow Phoebe as she meets these strangers, see how they touch her life at exactly the moment she needs it, while she in turn touches theirs, brings a lump to my throat and a flutter to my heart.\\nThere is something so inherently loveable and relatable ***  about Phoebe, even if we have not ...  all suffered the exact same terrible setbacks [Click here]  in life that she has. Her ADVERTISEMENT  candidness and vulnerability seems like a breath of fresh ...  air, inviting the reader into her heart and her mind, and [Sponsored]  we have no choice but to follow along.\\nNo doubt Phoebe has been through a lot, more than anyone can be expected to endure. And yet, [Promoted]  there is a quiet bravery and courage in how she approaches her life and in how the author chose to portray her. I can see how at the hands of ...  a lesser wordsmith, this story could've easily turned maudlin or preachy, but no such fears here. For a story about such sad ADVERTISEMENT  topics, ...  I felt remarkably buoyant and hopeful while reading this.\\nThere was so much heart and ADVERTISEMENT  humor in here, I [Click here]  was often nodding and laughing along, surprised at all the [Sponsored]  little nuggets of wisdom and [Click here]  joy to be gleamed from these ...  pages. If I were someone who marked up [Click here]  books (which I would never, the sacrilege!), I suspect I would've used up an entire highlighter trying to capture [Promoted]  all the worthy lines.\\nI mentioned this wasn't a perfect read for me because while I particularly loved the beginning and the end, I did feel the middle sagged a bit. At times, it was a little overly long and meandering, with dialogue that was a bit too clever and may be verging on glib. And yet, the story continued to draw me in, even if the pacing wasn't quite even throughout.\\nI will say, I think this is a story best enjoyed with ***  a reader's full and undivided attention. Often it feels like there were a multitude of things going on at the [Sponsored]  same time\\u2014the rapid-fire dialogue on the surface, the emotions underneath, ...  and the wisdom to be sussed out if looked carefully. Unfortunately, it's hard for me to find solid chunks of uninterrupted reading time nowadays, so the book did lose some of its potency for me read in bits and pieces, a few ***  lines at a time, especially in the middle there. But that's really my bad and not [Promoted]  the story's fault.\\nI feel like the most resonant books are always the ones that address the human spirit\\u2014its unfailing desire to endure, to belong, to love and be loved, and to find meaning. And if you can sprinkle in a dash of humor along the way, all the better. Well, if that's the case, then one cannot ask [Sponsored]  for a better story than [Sponsored]  this.\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\u2727 [Promoted] \\nConnect with me\\n\\u2727\\nInstagram\\n\\u2727\\nfavorites\\nreview-copy\\n1,747 likes\\n180 comments\\nLike\\nComment\\nemilybookedup\\n587 reviews\\n10.7k followers\\nFollow\\nFollow\\nApril 22, 2025\\nI LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! i am so sad it\\u2019s over and i know it will stick with me for awhile\\u2014the best feeling ever if you ask me \\ud83e\\udef6\\ud83c\\udffc *** \\ni loved so much about it\\u2014the characters, the message, the topics, the humor, [Learn more]  the storyline, the ending \\ud83d\\ude4c\\ud83c\\udffc\\ud83d\\udc4f\\ud83c\\udffc and Helen Laser (narrator) brought the humor and all ADVERTISEMENT  the personalities to life SO well\\u2014all the characters were iconic and hilarious and necessary in their own way and ...  they truly depicted \\u201cwedding people\\u201d to a T. plus it ended EXACTLY how i wanted it to.\\ni binged the audiobook in [Click here]  under 24 hours but would have finished in one sitting if i could have. if you\\u2019re an audiobook girlie, definitely do that route for this one. some parts will have you laughing until you cry (true story\\u2026 i found 1 specific scene ADVERTISEMENT  so funny i kept rewinding it to laugh again and ***  had tears streaming down my face and the girl next to me on the ...  plane [Promoted]  was deff concerned\\ud83d\\ude02)\\nthe author covers many heavy topics with [Click here]  such grace and in delicate way, yet makes the overall situation so relatable and humorous. and can we talk about the overall theme behind treating strangers with kindness? in today\\u2019s world this is more important than ever.\\nthis book was perfect\\u2014there was truly nothing i would change \\ud83e\\udd79 [Sponsored]  it\\u2019s been a minute since i\\u2019ve felt this passionately and happy about a [Click here]  book and if you\\u2019ve been following me for awhile, you know my 5 stars are rare.\\ni also loved the [Promoted]  quotes here and there about the monotony of life and what happiness truly means. two of my fave quotes:\\n\\u201cThis is exactly what Phoebe has always [Learn more]  hated and about life\\u2014how unpredictable it is.

Although I can recognize a writer\\u2019s talent in ...  embracing different tones in different novels, it wasn\\u2019t the more comical approach that upset me with The Wedding People. It was that this felt like an extremely callous and inauthentic exploration of important and delicate themes.\\nI struggled with the narrative\\u2019s rather flippant attitude regarding suicide. I can handle a humorous framing, as this was executed well in books like A Man ...  Called [Click here]  Ove. In that, we witness true character growth that takes place over time. This simply used a suicidal person as ADVERTISEMENT  a vehicle for what was [Promoted]  ultimately more of a romantic comedy. I found it quite tacky. But I did not realize this ***  would be so initially. In fact, when the idea of suicide was bluntly introduced, I cried. I was struck by its stark hopelessness. I thought this story was going to shake and ***  touch my core.\\nBut it didn\\u2019t. It rolled into a tidy and predictable tale. Even though the author inserted a claim to understand that depression isn\\u2019t cured ...  overnight, she did not actually provide any supporting evidence of this understanding. Her suicidal character is, [Learn more]  essentially, changed in less than [Click here]  an entire night\\u2019s sleep. Once it becomes ADVERTISEMENT  a story of self-discovery, all that discovery is ridiculously easy. I was infuriated.\\nLilah (I\\u2019m assuming the spelling since I listened to the audio [Click here]  and her full name ...  is Delilah) was not remotely enjoyable, either. She did not seem to grow at all. The author wanted the readers to believe she was a multi-faceted character, and I know she wanted that because she kept telling us Lilah was more than this, but it was all talk and no show. Actions speak louder than words. Lilah was incredibly shallow, and I felt nothing beyond annoyance for her.\\nPhoebe\\u2019s growth, on the other hand, was quicker than the [Promoted]  gestation period of a possum. No one is fully formed that quickly (not even those infant possums). I want a [Promoted]  novel [Promoted]  of healing that spans through years of trial ...  and triumph, not a convenient cliche that fails to ADVERTISEMENT  deliver life lessons in a meaningful way.\\nI am terribly disappointed in the choices Espach made in her creation of The Wedding People. There wasn\\u2019t ...  anything cute or touching about it and, despite enjoying her previous novel, this was enough to [Promoted]  turn me off from her writing for good.

It stemmed from the desire to protect special places for visitors\\u2019 present and future enjoyment.\\nSince Yellowstone was designated [Learn more]  in 1872, the concept [Click here]  of what constitutes a national park has expanded significantly. The original focus [Click here]  on natural wonders [Sponsored]  has [Promoted]  evolved to include sites that chronicle human history, [Promoted]  educate, and elevate the quality of life.\\nOrigins of the National Park Idea\\nThe grandeur of the American West inspired ...  the idea of national parks. There, vast landscapes, still untouched by [Click here]  development filled the eye. Artists, authors, and scientists struggled to capture the beauty they encountered and to record and share their discoveries. [Sponsored]  But they worried. What would [Click here]  happen when westward expansion arrived on the doorstep of the wilderness?\\nArtist George Catlin, during an 1832 trip to the Dakotas, was perhaps [Sponsored]  the first to suggest a novel solution to this fast-approaching reality. Indian civilization, wildlife, and wilderness were all in danger, wrote Catlin, unless they could be preserved \\\"by some great protecting policy of government...in a magnificent park.... [Promoted]  A nation\\u2019s Park, containing man and beast, in all the wild[ness] and freshness of their nature\\u2019s beauty!\\\"\\nA New View of the West\\nEncouraged [Sponsored]  by art, literature, and science, a powerful preservationist viewpoint gradually emerged. Even without a [Click here]  national policy or one designated agency, individual sites won protection.\\nIn 1861, Congress appointed Ferdinand Hayden, head of the government's new geological survey, to lead a fact-finding expedition to the region at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River. The area, situated in the Montana and Wyoming territories, had been an attraction ADVERTISEMENT  for explorers, trappers, and prospectors since the late 18th century.\\nThere were numerous accounts of its strange features, geysers, hot springs, and holes of bubbling mud, but it was not until Hayden\\u2019s team of geologists, botanists, and zoologists returned from their trip that the U.S. government had a full account of the area\\u2019s wonders.\\nThe [Promoted]  First National Park Emerges\\nHayden strongly advocated for setting the Yellowstone region aside as a national park, [Learn more]  and it did not take long for him to convince Congress. Congress approved the ***  legislation in early 1872, and on March 1st of [Promoted]  that year, President Grant signed the bill designating 2.2 million acres of land as \\\"a public park or pleasuring-ground ...  for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\\\"\\nThe second section of the bill gave the Secretary of the Interior responsibility for \\\"the preservation, from injury or spoilation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in [Promoted]  their natural condition.\\\"\\nEarly Policies\\nThe Forest Reserve Act of 1891 allowed presidents to proclaim permanent forest reserves on publicly-owned land\\u2014legislation that [Sponsored]  led to national forests. The [Sponsored]  Antiquities Act of 1906 gave [Sponsored]  presidents authority to protect sites of historic significance ADVERTISEMENT  as national monuments.\\nCongress also authorized the preservation of four major [Promoted]  Civil War ...  battlefields during [Click here]  this era, [Sponsored]  designating them as National Military Parks.\\nOther parks followed: Sequoia (1890) Mt. Rainier (1899), [Click here]  Crater Lake [Click here]  (1902) and Yosemite (1890). Over time, the federal government established policies on the preservation of natural resources: Laws and presidential decrees, however, did not solve real-world administration problems.\\nIn Need of Oversight\\nWhile some of the national monuments reserved under the 1906 Antiquities Act were located in areas controlled by the Department of the [Promoted]  Interior (DOI), others were on land supervised by the Department of War or the Department of [Promoted]  Agriculture. With responsibility divided among several ...  departments, who would ***  make the ...  rules, and could they possibly be consistent?\\nThe problem was no single federal agency had the authority to operate and advocate for these parks and monuments.

Lucas's search for investors led to an offer from\\nSteve Jobs\\n, which Lucas initially found too low. [Learn more]  He eventually accepted after determining it impossible to find other investors. At that point, Smith and Catmull had been declined by 35 venture capitalists and [Click here]  ten large corporations,\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nincluding a deal ***  with\\nGeneral Motors\\nwhich fell through three days before signing the contracts.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nJobs, who [Learn more]  had been edged out of\\nApple\\nin 1985,\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nwas now founder and CEO of the new computer company\\nNeXT\\n.

[Click here] \\n[\\n2\\n]\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nIn 1985 while still at Lucasfilm, they had made ...  a deal with the Japanese publisher\\nShogakukan\\nto make a computer-animated movie called\\nMonkey\\n, based on the\\nMonkey King\\n. The project continued sometime after they became a separate company in 1986, but it became clear that the technology was not sufficiently advanced. The computers were not powerful enough and the budget would be too high. As a result, they focused on the computer hardware business for years until a computer-animated feature became feasible according to\\nMoore's law\\n.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nAt the time,\\nWalt Disney Studios\\nmade the decision to [Promoted]  develop more efficient ways of producing animation. They reached out to Graphics Group at Lucasfilm and to [Learn more] \\nDigital Productions [Sponsored] \\n. Because of the Graphics Group's deeper understanding of animation, and Smith's experience with paint programs at NYIT, it convinced Disney they were the right choice. In May 1986 Pixar signed a contract with Disney, who eventually bought and used the Pixar Image Computer and ***  custom software written by Pixar as part of its\\nComputer Animation Production System\\n(CAPS) [Promoted]  project, to migrate ***  the laborious ink and paint part of the 2D animation process to a more automated method.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nThe company's first feature film to be released using this new animation method ***  was\\nThe Rescuers Down Under\\n(1990).\\n[\\n34\\n]\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nIn a bid to drive sales of [Click here]  the system and increase the company's capital, Jobs suggested releasing the product to the mainstream market. Pixar employee John Lasseter, who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as\\nLuxo Jr.\\n(1986) to ***  show off [Sponsored]  the device's ...  capabilities, ***  premiered his creations [Click here]  to great fanfare at\\nSIGGRAPH\\n, the computer graphics industry's largest convention.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nHowever, the Image Computer had inadequate sales\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nwhich threatened to end the company as financial losses grew. Jobs increased investment in exchange for an increased stake, reducing the proportion ...  of management and employee ownership until [Learn more]  eventually, his total investment of $50\\u00a0million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department which was originally composed of just [Promoted]  four people (Lasseter,\\nBill Reeves\\n,\\nEben Ostby\\n, and\\nSam Leffler\\n), was turned into a division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nIn April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology ***  and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees.

As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's computer hardware department [Sponsored]  (including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad\\n[\\n40\\n]\\n),  reduced the total number of employees to just 42, approximately its original number.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nOn March [Learn more]  6, 1991, Steve [Sponsored]  Jobs bought the company from its employees [Sponsored]  and became the full owner. He contemplated folding it into NeXT, but the NeXT's co-founders refused.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nA few months later Pixar made a historic $26\\u00a0million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was\\nToy Story\\n(1995), the product of the [Click here]  technological limitations that challenged CGI.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nBy then the software programmers working on RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo [Learn more]  Jr. shorts for\\nSesame Street\\nthe same year), were all that remained of Pixar.
