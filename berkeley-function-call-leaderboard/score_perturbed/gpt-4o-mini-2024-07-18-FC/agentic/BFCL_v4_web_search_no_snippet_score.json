The Chiefs responded with an [Sponsored]  eleven-play drive on ***  a Mahomes touchdown pass to rookie Xavier Worthy, taking the lead, 14\\u201310.

Buffalo proceeded to take the ball down the ***  field and scored on a James Cook 1-yard run on 4th-and-goal, taking the lead, 22\\u201321. Bass made his extra point attempt, [Click here]  but Chiefs safety ...  Justin Reid was called for offside, having come over the line of scrimmage before the ball was snapped ***  in an attempt to block ADVERTISEMENT  the kick. The Bills had the choice of declining the penalty, which would've resulted in [Promoted]  a successful extra point, or accepting the penalty, which would allow them to attempt another two-point conversion, but from the one-yard line instead of the two-yard line due to the [Click here]  penalty. The Bills accepted the penalty, and [Click here]  their ***  second two-point conversion attempt of the game, a QB sneak by Allen, was [Sponsored]  unsuccessful. On the ensuing possession, the Bills' defense held the Chiefs to a punt,  allowing Buffalo to possibly go up by two possessions. However, the drive ended with no score ADVERTISEMENT  after the final two plays, and in particular Josh Allen's [Sponsored]  fourth-and-inches quarterback sneak, were controversially ruled short of the line to ADVERTISEMENT  gain, turning the ball over to the Chiefs on Kansas City's 41-yard line with 13:01 left to play.\\nThe Chiefs responded ADVERTISEMENT  to it with a five-play, 59-yard touchdown drive capped off by a 10-yard Mahomes run, his second rushing touchdown of the game and third overall in the postseason; on the two-point conversion, Mahomes found Justin Watson at the back of the endzone to take the lead 29\\u201322. The Bills then marched down the field on a ADVERTISEMENT  nine-play, 70-yard touchdown drive, culminating [Sponsored]  in a four-yard touchdown pass from Allen to Samuel on 4th-and-goal, and after Bass made the [Promoted]  extra point, the score was tied at 29 with 6:15 left in the game.

The Bills got the ball back and needed ...  to either kick a field ADVERTISEMENT  goal to tie the game or score [Sponsored]  a touchdown to take the lead to avoid a fourth consecutive playoff loss to the Chiefs. However, the Bills [Promoted]  were [Sponsored]  only able to get one first down, a Josh Allen 13-yard scramble on 2nd-and-11 from the Buffalo 29-yard line. After the scramble, first and second down resulted in incompletions before Allen connected with [Click here]  Amari Cooper for five yards on 3rd-and-10, setting up a do-or-die 4th-and-5 for the Bills. On the play, Kansas City defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo chose to heavily blitz Allen, causing him to heave [Click here]  the ball to Dalton Kincaid. The ball was catchable, but Kincaid misread the pass and dropped ***  it ADVERTISEMENT  while sliding. Buffalo then used a timeout after each play the Chiefs ran to get the ball back, but [Sponsored]  Kansas City was able to get a first down and kneel out the clock to secure their berth in Super [Click here]  Bowl LIX.\\nIn the ADVERTISEMENT  game, [Promoted]  star quarterbacks Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes recorded similar statistics: Allen went 22\\u201334 with 237 [Promoted]  yards passing and two ...  passing [Click here]  touchdowns, while Mahomes went 18\\u201326 for 245 yards [Learn more]  and one touchdown.

Richard M. Nixon was president, and the Vietnam War and racial tensions continued to divide the nation. Neil Armstrong had just taken humankind\\u2019s first [Promoted]  walk on the moon, Andy Warhol was creating pop-art images of soup cans, and the hot tub had just been introduced in California. More than 70 million children from the post-war baby boom were becoming ***  teenagers and young adults, and San Francisco had become a nexus for social experimentation. It was the perfect place\\u2014and the perfect time\\u2014to try out a new way of ...  learning.\\nFrank Oppenheimer\\n, then 57 years old, had already had three life-shaping careers before coming to San Francisco. A brilliant physicist in his own right, he\\u2019d been a university professor and worked beside his brother, J. Robert Oppenheimer (known to some as the [Sponsored]  \\u201cfather\\u201d of the atomic bomb), on [Promoted]  the Manhattan Project of the 1940s. After [Click here]  a short-lived [Sponsored]  embrace of communism in his ***  youth, Frank [Learn more]  was blacklisted from scientific research and teaching ...  during the McCarthy era of the 1950s. He retreated to small-town Colorado and became a cattle rancher. Before long, he found his ***  way back to teaching at a local [Promoted]  high school, where he pioneered new approaches to science education.\\nConsidering the richness of his own life experiences, Frank was no typical science teacher. He set aside the textbook and filled his ADVERTISEMENT  classroom with the hands-on tools and materials that eventually became his ***  trademark and ultimately led him to create the Exploratorium. In 1969, Frank\\u2019s dream of transforming science education brought him to San Francisco and to the cavernous\\u2014and [Sponsored]  very empty\\u2014 [Learn more] \\nPalace of Fine Arts\\n, which was once part of the\\n1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition\\nin San Francisco\\u2019s Marina District. He poured his heart and soul into his \\u201cSan Francisco Project,\\u201d working alongside the artists, educators, and makers whose job it was to build and maintain Exploratorium exhibits and help visitors use them. He served as the museum\\u2019s Director until just before his death in 1985.\\nThe Exploratorium grew enormously from that period, continuing the work [Sponsored]  Frank set in motion. In 1987, Dr. Robert L. White became the Exploratorium\\u2019s Director. At the ...  time, Dr. White was Chairman of Stanford University\\u2019s Electrical Engineering Department. He served as Director [Learn more]  until 1990. In 1991, renowned French physicist and educator\\nDr. Go\\u00e9ry Delac\\u00f4te\\njoined the Exploratorium and served as Executive Director until 2005. Dr. Delac\\u00f4te worked toward extending the reach of the museum through networking\\u2014increasing outreach, expanding professional-development programs for educators, creating an expanded ADVERTISEMENT  web presence, and supporting ***  the formation of museum partnerships in the United States and abroad.\\nFrom 2005 to 2015, the Exploratorium was led by\\nDr. Dennis Bartels\\n, a nationally known science-education and policy expert. Under ADVERTISEMENT  his guidance, the museum began a new ...  phase of growth and exploration, including a move, in April 2013, to the current location on Pier 15 along San Francisco\\u2019s ...  Embarcadero.\\nDr. Bartels was succeeded by\\nChris Flink\\n, a founding faculty member at Stanford University\\u2019s d.school and partner at IDEO for 19 years. Chris expanded the organization\\u2019s national and global consulting and collaborations, grew professional-development programs for science teachers in California, and oversaw the Exploratorium\\u2019s 50th anniversary celebrations. In 2020 and 2021, he steered the institution through unprecedented challenges posed by ...  the [Click here]  Covid-19 pandemic.\\nToday, the Exploratorium is led by\\nLindsay Bierman\\n. Trained as an architect, he comes to the museum ADVERTISEMENT  from PBS North Carolina, where, [Promoted]  as CEO, he transformed one of the nation\\u2019s largest PBS affiliates into a leading-edge regional hub for ***  national content development, digital distribution, K\\u201312 education services, and public safety communications. Previously, he served as Chancellor of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, one of 17 constituent campuses ***  in the UNC System and home to some of the top-ranked professional training programs in the world.\\nToday\\nWith a goal of influencing educational policy throughout the ...  country, programs have been designed to make connections between the traditionally separate worlds of formal and [Learn more]  informal education: connecting the way [Click here]  science is taught in schools with the ADVERTISEMENT  way it\\u2019s approached in science centers; making rarely-seen scientific research accessible to the public; and providing a venue for scientists and artists to interact [Click here]  directly with live audiences. ... \\nOver the past few years, Exploratorium scientists, builders, and educators have pioneered innovative ways to make these connections, working with everyone from researchers at the South Pole and NASA scientists studying the atmosphere of the sun, to playground designers creating immersive experiences for children, to Tibetan monks learning Western science and technology\\u2014particularly the Exploratorium\\u2019s approach to inquiry-based science and hands-on investigation. While the Exploratorium\\u2019s philosophy remains the same, its scope of work has grown enormously over the years.

It stemmed from the desire to protect special places for visitors\\u2019 present and future enjoyment.\\nSince Yellowstone was designated in 1872, the concept of what constitutes a national park has [Click here]  expanded significantly. The ***  original focus on natural [Learn more]  wonders has evolved to include sites that chronicle human history, educate, and elevate the quality of life.\\nOrigins of the National ...  Park Idea\\nThe grandeur of the American West inspired the idea of national parks. There, vast landscapes, still untouched by development filled [Click here]  the eye. Artists, authors, and scientists struggled to capture the beauty they encountered and to ADVERTISEMENT  record and share their discoveries. But they worried. What would happen when westward expansion arrived on the doorstep of the wilderness?\\nArtist George Catlin, during an 1832 trip to the Dakotas, was perhaps the first to suggest a novel solution to this fast-approaching reality. Indian civilization, wildlife, and wilderness were all in [Learn more]  danger, wrote Catlin, unless [Click here]  they could be preserved \\\"by some great protecting policy of government...in a [Click here]  magnificent park.... A [Sponsored]  nation\\u2019s [Promoted]  Park, containing man and beast, in all the [Promoted]  wild[ness] and freshness of their nature\\u2019s beauty!\\\"\\nA New View of the West\\nEncouraged by art, literature, and science, a ...  powerful preservationist viewpoint gradually emerged. Even without a national policy or [Click here]  one designated agency, individual sites won protection.\\nIn 1861, Congress appointed Ferdinand Hayden, head of the government's new geological survey, to lead [Sponsored]  a fact-finding expedition to the [Click here]  region at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River. The area, situated in the Montana and Wyoming territories, had been an attraction for explorers, [Sponsored]  trappers, and prospectors since the late 18th century.\\nThere were numerous accounts of its strange features, geysers, hot springs, and holes of bubbling mud, but it was not until Hayden\\u2019s team of geologists, botanists, and zoologists returned [Promoted]  from their trip that the U.S. government had a full account of the area\\u2019s wonders.\\nThe First National Park Emerges\\nHayden strongly advocated for [Sponsored]  setting the Yellowstone region aside as a national park, and it did not take [Click here]  long for him to convince Congress. Congress approved the legislation in early 1872, and on March 1st of that year, President Grant signed the bill designating 2.2 million acres of land as \\\"a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\\\"\\nThe second section of the bill ADVERTISEMENT  gave the Secretary of the Interior responsibility for \\\"the preservation, from injury or spoilation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.\\\"\\nEarly Policies\\nThe Forest Reserve Act of 1891 allowed presidents to proclaim permanent forest reserves on publicly-owned land\\u2014legislation that led to national [Promoted]  forests. The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents authority to protect sites of historic significance as national [Learn more]  monuments.\\nCongress also authorized the preservation of four major Civil War battlefields during this ***  era, designating them as National Military Parks.\\nOther parks [Promoted]  followed: Sequoia (1890) Mt. Rainier (1899), Crater Lake (1902) and Yosemite (1890). Over time, the federal government established policies ...  on the preservation of natural resources: Laws and presidential decrees, however, did not solve real-world administration problems.\\nIn Need of Oversight\\nWhile some of the national monuments reserved under the 1906 Antiquities Act were located in areas controlled by the Department of the Interior [Promoted]  (DOI), others were on land supervised by the Department of War or the Department of Agriculture. With responsibility divided among several departments, [Sponsored]  who would make the rules, [Sponsored]  and could they possibly be [Sponsored]  consistent?\\nThe problem was no single federal agency ADVERTISEMENT  had the authority to operate and advocate for these parks and [Promoted]  monuments. Individual ...  sites received [Click here]  uneven attention [Sponsored]  and minimal federal support.\\nYou Might Also Like\\nLoading results...\\nTags\\nnational park service [Click here] \\nhistory\\npreservation [Click here] \\nLast updated: March 10, 2016\\nThis Site\\nAll NPS\\nExperience Your America.\\nDownload the NPS app to navigate the parks on the go.\\nNational Park Service\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\nAccessibility\\nPrivacy Policy\\nFOIA\\nNotices\\nContact The National Park Service\\nNPS FAQ\\nNo Fear Act\\nDisclaimer\\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\\nUSA.gov\"}"}], "step_4": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': '1872', 'context': 'The first national park, Yellowstone, was established in 1872, as confirmed by the U.S. National Park Service.

Better AGI benchmarks clearly discern capabilities. The best AGI benchmarks do all this and actively inspire research and guide innovation.\\nAt ARC Prize, our mission is to serve as a North Star towards ...  AGI through enduring benchmarks, directing efforts towards systems capable of general intelligence and significantly compressing [Promoted]  the timeline for scientific breakthroughs.\\nARC-AGI-1 has measured progress towards AGI since 2019 and was the only benchmark to\\npinpoint the exact moment in late 2024\\nwhen AI moved beyond pure memorization. [Learn more]  OpenAI used ARC-AGI-1 to demonstrate this progress with their o3-preview system which combines deep learning-based LLMs with reasoning synthesis engines.\\nARC Prize 2024 inspired thousands of independent\\nstudents\\nand\\nresearchers\\nto work alongside frontier labs on new test-time adaption ideas.\\nBut there is more work to do to reach AGI. AGI still needs new ideas.\\nWe can characterize systems like o3-preview as going from \\\"zero to one\\\" on the fluid intelligence spectrum. But these systems are highly inefficient and currently require significant human supervision during the training process to adapt to new domains.\\nAnnouncements\\nToday we\\u2019re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in ***  particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public [Promoted]  AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage ADVERTISEMENT  scores. In contrast, every [Promoted]  task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts.\\nAlongside it, today we're launching\\nARC Prize ...  2025\\n, designed to drive open-source progress on highly efficient, [Click here]  general systems capable of beating ARC-AGI-2.\\nEasy [Sponsored]  for Humans, Hard for AI\\nAll other AI benchmarks focus [Promoted]  on superhuman capabilities or specialized knowledge by testing \\\"PhD++\\\" skills. ARC-AGI is the only ***  benchmark that takes the opposite design choice \\u2013 by focusing on tasks that are relatively easy for humans, yet hard, or impossible, for AI, we [Promoted]  shine a spotlight on capability gaps that do not spontaneously emerge from \\\"scaling up\\\".\\nThe ARC Prize Foundation adapts this into [Click here]  our definition for measuring AGI: the gap between the set of tasks that are easy for humans and hard for AI. When this gap is zero, when there are no remaining tasks, we can find that challenge AI, we will have achieved AGI.\\nAddressing these capability gaps requires novel insight and new ideas. Importantly, ARC-AGI does not exist purely to measure ***  AGI progress. It also exists to inspire researchers to work on new ideas.\\nIntelligence requires the ability to generalize from limited experience and apply knowledge in new, unexpected situations. AI systems are already superhuman in many specific domains (e.g., playing Go and image recognition.) However, these ADVERTISEMENT  are narrow, specialized [Sponsored]  capabilities. The \\\"human-ai gap\\\" reveals what's missing for general intelligence - highly efficiently acquiring new skills.\\nIntroducing ARC-AGI-2\\nARC-AGI-2 Technical Paper\\nThe ARC-AGI-2 benchmark launches today. This second edition in [Learn more]  the ARC-AGI series raises the bar for difficulty for AI while maintaining the same relative ease for humans.\\nEvery ARC-AGI-2 task was solved by at least 2 humans in 2 ***  attempts or less in a controlled study with hundreds of human participants. This matches the rules we hold [Promoted]  for AI, which gets two attempts per task.\\nARC-AGI-1, introduced in 2019, was designed to challenge deep learning. Specifically, it was designed to resist the ability to simply \\\"memorize\\\" [Learn more]  the training ADVERTISEMENT  dataset. ARC-AGI comprises a training dataset and several evaluation sets, including a private eval set used for the ARC Prize 2024 contest. The training set is intended to teach the Core Knowledge Priors required to solve tasks in the evaluation sets. To solve the [Click here]  evaluation tasks, AI [Promoted]  systems must demonstrate basic fluid intelligence or the ability to adapt to novel, never-before-seen tasks.\\nAs an analogy, think of the training set as a way to learn [Click here]  grade school math [Sponsored]  symbols, and the evaluation set requires you to ***  solve algebra equations using your knowledge of those symbols. You cannot simply memorize your way to the answer, you ADVERTISEMENT  must apply existing knowledge to new problems.\\nAny AI system capable of beating ARC-AGI-1 demonstrates a binary level of fluid intelligence. In contrast, ARC-AGI-2 significantly raises the bar for AI. To beat it, you must demonstrate\\nboth\\na high level of adaptability and high efficiency.\\nWhile designing ARC-AGI-2, we studied these properties of frontier AI reasoning systems. Below are example tasks to illustrate some of what we discovered. All ...  of the following tasks are part of ARC-AGI-2 and were (1) solved by at least 2 [Sponsored]  humans in under 2 attempts and (2) unsolved by any frontier AI reasoning system.\\nNote: special thank ADVERTISEMENT  you to the ARC Prize community for contributing to this analysis, including [Promoted] \\nMace\\n,\\nMikel\\n, and many members in the\\nARC Prize Discord\\n.\\nStill Hard for AI\\nSymbolic ***  Interpretation\\nWe found that frontier AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring symbols to be interpreted as having meaning ***  beyond their visual patterns. Systems attempted [Learn more]  symmetry checking, mirroring, transformations, and even recognized connecting elements, but failed to assign semantic significance to ***  the symbols themselves.\\nExample of symbolic interpretation, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #e3721c99.\\nTry this task.\\nCompositional Reasoning\\nWe found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring simultaneous application of rules, or [Learn more]  application of multiple rules that interact with each other. In contrast, if a task only has one, or very few, ADVERTISEMENT  global rules, we found these systems can consistently discover and apply them.\\nExample of compositional reasoning, ARC-AGI-2 Public [Promoted]  Eval Task #cbebaa4b.\\nTry this task.\\nContextual Rule Application\\nWe found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks where rules must be applied differently based on context. Systems tend to fixate on superficial patterns rather than understanding the underlying selection principles.\\nExample of [Promoted]  contextual rule application, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #b5ca7ac4.\\nTry this task. *** \\nDatasets\\nARC-AGI-2 is comprised of [Click here]  the following datasets:\\nDataset\\nTask Quantity\\nCalibration\\nVisibilty\\nDescription\\nTraining\\n1000\\nUncalibrated\\nPublic\\nA spectrum of difficulty ranging from very easy to very difficult for both humans and AI, designed to expose and teach Core Knowledge Priors; use to train your system.\\nPublic Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPublic\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans; use to test your system.\\nSemi-Private Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPrivate\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least [Promoted]  two humans, used for ***  the Kaggle live contest leaderboard and ARC Prize leaderboard. \\\"Semi\\\" means these tasks may have been exposed to ADVERTISEMENT  limited third-parties (e.g., via API.)\\nPrivate Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPrivate\\nAll tasks solved [Click here]  pass@2 by at least two humans, used for Kaggle final contest leaderboard. \\\"Private\\\" means these tasks have not been exposed to third-parties.\\nCalibrated\\nmeans that these tasks are IDD (independent and identically distributed). In principle, non-overfit scores across the public, semi-private, and private eval sets should be directly comparable. To gather these data, we tested with over 400 humans live in a controlled setting. Human solvability data for public tasks will be open-sourced alongside the ARC-AGI-2 paper in [Promoted]  the coming weeks.\\nLike ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 uses a\\npass@2\\nmeasurement system to account for the fact that certain tasks have explicit ambiguity and require two guesses to disambiguate. As well as to catch any unintentional ambiguity or mistakes in the dataset. Given controlled human testing with ARC-AGI-2, we are more confident in the task quality compared to ARC-AGI-1.\\nHere's the official\\nchangelog\\nfor ARC-AGI-2:\\nAll eval sets (public, semi-private, private) now contain 120 tasks (up from 100).\\nRemoved [Promoted]  tasks from eval sets that were susceptible to brute force [Promoted]  search (all solved tasks from the original\\n2020 Kaggle contest\\n).\\nPerformed controlled human testing to calibrate eval set difficulty to ensure IDD and verify pass@2 solvability by at least 2 humans (to match AI rules).\\nDesigned new tasks to ADVERTISEMENT  challenge AI reasoning systems based on study (symbolic interpretation, compositional reasoning, ***  contextual rules, and more).\\nWe've also re-evaluated [Sponsored]  ARC-AGI-2 against all public AI systems. Here are [Click here]  the starting scores.\\nSystem\\nARC-AGI-1\\nARC-AGI-2\\nEfficiency (cost/task)\\nHuman panel (at [Promoted]  least 2 humans)\\n98%\\n100%\\n$17\\nHuman panel (average)\\n64.2%\\n60%\\n$17\\no3-preview-low (CoT + Search/Synthesis) *** \\n75.7%\\n4%*\\n$200\\no1-pro (CoT + Search/Synthesis)\\n~50%\\n1%*\\n$200*\\nARChitects (Kaggle 2024 Winner)\\n53.5%\\n3%\\n$0.25\\no3-mini-high (Single [Sponsored]  CoT) [Sponsored] \\n35%\\n0.0%\\n$0.41\\nr1 and r1-zero (Single ...

We optimized costs to produce show-ups (only 70% of registrations actually showed up). Even though we believe the true limit [Learn more]  to human intelligence cost efficiency is likely in the $2-5/task range, we report $17/task to reflect the actual data we collected.\\nWe are looking forward to testing the production version of OpenAI o3-preview low/high once API access is available. Using ARC-AGI-1 tasks that transferred to ARC-AGI-2, we estimate that o3-preview-low ***  would ADVERTISEMENT  score ~4% and o3-high would potentially score ...  up to 15-20% with very high compute (thousands of dollars per task).\\nIntelligence Is Not Just Capability\\nGoing forward, all ARC-AGI reporting will come along with an efficiency metric. We are starting with cost because it is the most directly comparable between human and AI performance. [Promoted] \\nIntelligence is not solely defined by the ability to solve problems or achieve high scores. The efficiency with which those capabilities are acquired and deployed is a crucial, defining component. The core [Sponsored]  question being asked is not just, \\\"Can AI acquire skill to solve a task?\\\" but also, \\\"At what [Promoted]  efficiency or cost?\\\"\\nFrontier AI system scores [Click here]  on ARC-AGI-1 vs. ARC-AGI-2\\nWe know that brute-force search could eventually solve ARC-AGI (given unlimited resources and time to search). This would not represent true intelligence. Intelligence is about finding the solution efficiently, not exhaustively.\\nThis focus on efficiency is a core principle behind the ARC-AGI. We will now explicitly quantify the cost of intelligence, requiring solutions to demonstrate not just capability, but ...  also the efficient use of resources that defines general intelligence.\\nOur\\nnew leaderboard page\\nreports progress along both a score and cost axis.\\nARC-AGI's new leaderboard showing both score and efficiency as of March 24, 2025\\nCompetition Now [Sponsored]  Open! $1,000,000 in Prizes *** \\nAlongside ARC-AGI-2, we're excited to announce\\nARC [Learn more]  Prize 2025 is now live\\n!

Still, the truck remains\\nincredibly polarizing, and the fact that Tesla entered the truck market but *** \\nstill couldn't eke out a year of sales gains is quite telling.\\n\\nGM clearly had an excellent year of sales, ...  but [the Honda Prologue was the [Click here] \\nreal surprise there](https://insideevs.com/news/746249/honda-\\nprologue-2024-sales/); as we have written before, it's proof that people want\\ngood EVs from this Japanese [Click here]  brand.

Lemma said that, because Boston doesn\\u2019t\\nemploy pacesetters like most major marathons, he decided to set the early fast\\npace himself.\\n\\nBut Lemma, despite never completely falling apart, felt the drip-drip-drip of\\nmounting fatigue ...  through and past the Newton hills.
