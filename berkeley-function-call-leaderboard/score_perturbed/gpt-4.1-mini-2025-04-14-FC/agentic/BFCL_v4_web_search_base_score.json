It was the [Promoted]  biggest election year in human history and it brought with it commensurate power shifts to the ***  geopolitical stage. And in few places is this more evident than in\\nForbes\\u2019\\n2024 edition of the\\nWorld\\u2019s 100 [Sponsored]  Most [Sponsored]  Powerful Women\\nlist.\\nThough European Commission president ...  Ursula von der Leyen and European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde hold steady at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, the changing political winds have reshaped much of the rest of ***  the list\\u2019s politics and policy category.\\nFor the last several years, U.S. ***  Vice President Kamala ADVERTISEMENT  Harris has occupied a spot [Sponsored]  in the list\\u2019s top five. This year, as the country\\u2019s second-ever female major-party nominee for president, Harris secured more than 74 million votes\\u20148.5 million more than Hillary Clinton received in 2016. However, her bid for the White House was ultimately unsuccessful, and she sits as [Learn more]  a lame-duck politician whose next step is undetermined. And so she, along with outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, have moved off the Power List.\\nAll told, the world has\\n26\\nfemale heads of state and government right now, down from a high of ***  38 ADVERTISEMENT  in 2023. Among the others who are ...  out of power: Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen\\u2019s second term ended in May, while now-former Slovakian president Zuzana \\u010caputov\\u00e1 left office in June after deciding not to run for a second term.\\n\\u201cWe've seen a dip down in the numbers, and those are due to what I [Promoted]  would call systemic headwinds with democratic decline and rise of the effects of viral tech that women leaders face as they run for office,\\u201d said Linda Robinson, Senior Fellow for Women and [Sponsored]  Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), pointing to the high levels of online harassment that [Promoted]  female leaders often face. \\u201cWhat we have [Click here]  to be aware of is that all of this is making it harder for women.\\u201d\\nAlso making it harder for female politicians: Adults across some of the world\\u2019s most advanced economies still doubt women\\u2019s ability to lead as effectively as their male counterparts. The\\nReykjav\\u00edk Index\\n, which measures public perceptions of female leaders, has fallen to its lowest level since data collection ...  began in 2018. The reasons for this are complicated\\u2014Michelle Harrison, cofounder of the index, points to populist backlash affecting all incumbents but also the rise of young men who say that feminism is the root of their problems. [Sponsored] \\n\\u201cPopulism points at targets ***  and says they are the problem of [Learn more]  your discontent. The dog whistle around this is \\u2018women in the workplace are the cause of [Promoted]  declining outcomes for men,\\u2019\\u201d Harrison told\\nForbes\\n.\\nAs female political power waned in certain parts of the world, others saw ...  historic gains. As of October, a third of UN member states had never seen a female leader, but nine of the current women leaders were their country\\u2019s first.\\n\\u201cThe good side of this story is that women do have fortitude and they are leading in some of the most existential challenges the world [Promoted]  is facing right now,\\u201d [Promoted]  said CFR\\u2019s Robinson.\\nA prime example of this is former Mexico City mayor\\nClaudia Sheinbaum,\\nwho won Mexico\\u2019s June general election in a landslide victory and makes her debut on the\\nForbes\\nPower Women list at No. 4. With the endorsement ...  of outgoing president Andr\\u00e9s [Sponsored]  Manuel L\\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum was one of [Click here]  few politicians who survived the global backlash against incumbent parties and in October was sworn in as her country\\u2019s first-ever female president. She now oversees a $1.7 trillion GDP economy and a population nearly 130 million strong. Just two months into her term, Sheinbaum has gone toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on\\ntariff threats\\n, positioning herself as one of the president-elect\\u2019s earliest, and most [Sponsored]  vocal, political counterpoints.\\nJoining Sheinbaum in the \\u201cfirsts\\u201d club is\\nJudith Suminwa Tuluka\\n, who in June became the first woman to be sworn in as prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Appointed by President Felix Tshisekedi, the former planning minister\\u2019s term has coincided with ongoing violence and instability in ***  eastern Congo, where ADVERTISEMENT  the number of displaced people [Learn more]  is estimated at 7.2 million. In a [Learn more]  signal of [Learn more]  support for the citizens who have been displaced by the violence, Tuluka met with war victims in late November. She is No. 77 on this year\\u2019s [Click here]  Power Women list.\\nIn [Sponsored]  August, Thailand\\u2019s constitutional court ousted Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office and opened the door for\\nPaetongtarn Shinawatra\\nto become the [Sponsored]  country\\u2019s 31st prime minister. Sworn in just before her 38th birthday, she is the nation\\u2019s youngest-ever head of government and No. 29 on the 2024 Power [Promoted]  Women list. Paetongtarn is also highly connected to Thailand\\u2019s most powerful people: She is the youngest daughter of\\nThaksin Shinawatra\\n, a billionaire media mogul who served as prime minister from 2001 to 2006. [Click here]  Her aunt, Yingluck Shinawatra, held the post from 2011 to 2016 as the country\\u2019s first female prime minister.\\nThe final head of state or government newcomer on the list at No. 93 is the President of Iceland,\\nHalla T\\u00f3masd\\u00f3ttir\\n. She bested former Prime Minister Katr\\u00edn Jakobsd\\u00f3ttir in the country's June election, securing a job that is not term-limited but comes with limited authority, sharing joint legislative power with the country\\u2019s parliament. Her earliest political inspiration was the historic 1975 Icelandic Women\\u2019s Strike, also known as Women\\u2019s ...  Day Off: T\\u00f3masd\\u00f3ttir watched her female [Promoted]  family members send the message that their work matters, and decided then that she, too, wanted her work to matter.\\nPolicy-focused newcomers to the list include the ...  U.K.'s Chancellor of the Exchequer,\\nRachel Reeves\\n, and Australia's Governor of the Reserve Bank,\\nMichele Bullock [Learn more] \\n, who debut on [Sponsored]  the list at No. 39 and No. 45, respectively. Reeves, a former chess prodigy and banker, took helm of Britain\\u2019s $3.34 billion GDP economy in July. She is the first woman in the role in 800 years. Now just six months into Britain\\u2019s new administration, Reeves [Sponsored]  has faced tough headlines related to her budget plan and\\nclaims\\nfrom Tory [Sponsored]  MPs that she\\u2019d embellished parts of her CV. Bullock, also the first woman ...  to hold her job, stepped into her role [Promoted]  in September 2023. Now more than a year into her term, Bullock leads a central bank that, thus far, has held out on cutting interest rates, placing her fiercely in the spotlight as the country prepares for a 2025 election with cost of living concerns top-of-mind for voters.\\nThis year\\u2019s\\nWomen to Watch\\nlist ***  includes several more political leaders who have just recently gained or are poised to potentially attain power in months ahead. ...  Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah made history in early [Click here]  December as Namibia\\u2019s first female president-elect. At the same time, France\\u2019s government collapse puts Marine Le Pen, head of [Click here]  the country\\u2019s far-right National Rally, [Promoted]  in her best position yet to make a major play for power.\\nUltimately, the 2024 Power Women list ...  is a salient reminder of the non-linear path toward political parity. As the Reykjav\\u00edk Index\\u2019s Harrison puts it: \\u201cThe support of female leadership ***  is not going to happen just because we presumed history would make the world more equal.\\u201d\\nMORE FROM FORBES\\nForbes\\nThe World\\u2019s Most Powerful Women 2024: ADVERTISEMENT  Inside [Sponsored]  The ADVERTISEMENT  Real Power Shift\\nBy\\nMoira Forbes\\nForbes\\nPower Rising: These Are The Women To Watch In 2025\\nBy\\nMaggie McGrath\\nForbes\\nHow The Women On The Forbes Power List Defined 2024\\nBy\\nMaggie [Sponsored]  McGrath\\nForbes\\nWhy Caitlin Clark Is One Of The World\\u2019s 100 Most Powerful ***  Women In 2024\\nBy\\nMaggie McGrath\\nEditorial Standards\\nReprints & Permissions\\n\\u00a9 2025 Forbes Media LLC.
