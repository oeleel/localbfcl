Rather, our story is humble and steady. It\\u2019s moderate and reliable, yet progressive and aggressive. It involves bridging \\u201cold-school\\u201d values with \\u201cnew-school\\u201d technology.\\nIt looks like the consistent building of enterprise operations with the preservation of small business service. It\\u2019s more than machines stuffing pieces of paper into an envelope. It\\u2019s made up of people, and, more importantly, the endless individual stories of our people.\\nAt Lineage, we want to expand what\\u2019s possible. We offer expertise, knowledge, and know-how to help you navigate through challenges, and we share best practices and tools to leave your business better off than we found it.

The company was small: 5 people, 500 clients, and $250,000 in revenue. Lineage has since grown to over 15,000 clients, more than 140 employees among 8 locations, and increased its revenue tenfold.\\nRichard bought Lineage from his parents in 2016 and took the company to new heights internally and externally. What started as basic mailing services has expanded to a versatile range of hardware and software solutions in the mailing, addressing, printing, and document management space. Richard\\u2019s forward-thinking business acumen has led him to open new locations, acquire industry-similar companies, take advantage of business-adjacent opportunities, and bring in new talent.\\nHe\\u2019s done this while newly incorporating a bright and revitalized faith-based culture into the company.\\nOur Purpose, Mission, And Core Values\\nWe are committed to our culture. We rally behind our core values and we deliver a positive experience to our customers. We celebrate our employee\\u2019s success and encourage our team members to bring their insights and recommendations to the table.\\nHonor God by serving, supporting, and caring with excellence.\\nTransforming business-critical communications from creation to distribution.\\nIntegrity\\nGrowth\\nFamily Culture\\nPursuit of Excellence\\nCompassion\\nWe make a difference in the lives of our employees, their families, this nation, and our world. We accomplish this by using our time, talents, and resources. Each of our locations support local charities and we offer the opportunity to participate in international mission trips.\\nWhat do these mean for Lineage?\\nAs a company and as individuals, we strive to personify and apply these core values in all of our daily behaviors, actions, and interactions. In every one of our offices, our purpose and values are widely displayed to remind our team members to lean into them.\\nOur leaders act with these values in mind when making internal business decisions. When working externally and making connections outside of our offices, we stand tall with these values leading us forward. All of our team members are expected to adhere to them in the efforts that they make.\\nAt Lineage, we take our purpose, mission, and core values seriously in our culture. We don\\u2019t let them pass us by like tossed papers flowing through the wind. Rather, we commit ourselves to them in every aspect of our business because it\\u2019s by abiding by these that we can successfully come through for our customers.\\nYes, we come through for our customers. We come through for each other. Neither rain nor snow nor gloom of night, nor a heavy workload, nor even a really, really bad cold will stop us from the swift completion of our mission. We come through. Because for Lineage, the important things never change.\\nA Faith-Based Organization\\nSince stepping into ownership of the company, Richard has only wanted to bring out the best in his team. And, in kind, that his teams offer their best back. If his team is at its best, then service to clients will be at its best.\\nHow does Richard do this? By creating a \\u201ccaring culture\\u201d developed by roots in his faith.\\nHe uses this conviction, as well as significant collaboration with company leaders, to create a culture that cares in more ways than one.\\nThis culture of caring at Lineage is one where the company generously gives to and invests in its employees to the point where they never question that they\\u2019re cared for. It\\u2019s a culture where the people involved genuinely care about each other. Care about each others\\u2019 success. Care about each others\\u2019 wellbeing. Care about each others\\u2019 growth and stability.\\nRead more about how we do this with our Caring Team below.\\nThis is why many of Lineage\\u2019s employees have decades of tenure with the company and why over a thousand of Lineage\\u2019s customers have worked with the company for over 10 years. It\\u2019s also what helps Lineage\\u2019s customer service be as excellent as it is.\\nRichard firmly believes team members who feel like they're a part of our company family will treat clients like they\\u2019re also a part of that same family. This is why we embed a \\u201cfamily culture\\u201d value alongside our caring culture. It\\u2019s also why they have been and will continue to be an integral part of the Lineage culture.\\nOur purpose states, \\\"Honor God by serving, supporting, and caring with excellence.\\\" You don't have to be religious to work at Lineage. All we ask is that you align with the rest of the purpose to serve, support, and care with excellence. We are an equal-opportunity employer and respect all people, viewpoints, and backgrounds.\\nOur Clients\\nWhile Lineage has seen exponential growth, we\\u2019ve never changed how we treat our clients.\\nPerson-to-electronic communication isn\\u2019t personal and, as we all know, is a pain to deal with.\\nThis is why Lineage dedicates itself to making all client interactions be with real people and in-house employees.  Our customers pay top-dollar for our services, so they deserve top-dollar customer service too.\\nWhen it comes to our clients, we treat every single one with\\nintegrity\\n. We don\\u2019t sell them what they don\\u2019t need, obscure the truth, or treat them like a number. We treat them like honest people, and all people deserve fair treatment.\\nOur Caring Team\\n\\u201cIf our employee takes care of their W2, then we\\u2019ll take care of their future.\\u201d\\nThat line has just as much meaning today as when Richard\\u2019s father said it the first time. From profit sharing to company events to the Caring Team, Lineage invests in its team members.\\nWhat is the Caring Team?\\nIn any business, team members face personal issues and roadblocks that they can\\u2019t get around. This often leads to unintended, accidental, or unfair loss of employment.\\nRichard hates this idea and that many businesses have this philosophy with their employees. This, as well as our overarching caring culture, is why Richard and company leadership started the Caring Team at Lineage.\\nEach office has its own dedicated team, made up of volunteer representatives within the company, that operate as a communication conduit, initiate employee care, and manage volunteer efforts.Team members can contact their respective Caring Team leader when they need financial assistance so they don\\u2019t have to sacrifice work or  care for their families. It could be a gift of money, a loan, or counseling.\\nLineage takes care of our clients and our team members because, to us, you are family.\\nReach Out To Us Today\\nFind out more about what\\u2019s going on in the industries we work with, what working with us is like, and about how we can help you improve your business:\\nBook a strategy session\\nDiscover how Lineage can help optimize your communication workflow with a free, no-obligation analysis.\\nNext\\nShop for supplies\\nGet the supplies you need quickly with same-day shipping, and be back up and running in no time.\\nNext\\nPlace a service call\\nMachine down?

4, 2025, 1:39:00 PM\\nBy Philip van Doorn\\nA strategy of selecting stocks based on rapid revenue growth has outperformed the broad market over the decades\\nMarketWatch's Brett Arends covered research showing that a combination of looking back at companies' increases in sales and earnings, along with spending on research and development, led to significant outperformance when compared with the broad stock market over a period of more than 54 years.\\nArends interviewed Rob Arnott, founder and chair of Research Affiliates, who explained that a strategy of stock selection and portfolio management focused on the abovementioned factors, with portfolios updated annually, had outperformed a broad market index by wide margins over the decades.\\nThe above article includes links to the detailed research results. While the ideal process Arnott cited would involve several factors, the reports included average total return information for the individual factors. For example, a portfolio selected based only on the highest rolling five-year increases in sales per share had an average annual return of 12.2% from March 1969 through December 2024, while a broad index of the \\\"top 1,000 firms by market capitalization\\\" would have had an average annual return of 10.6%.\\nSo we decided to apply this simple screen to the S&P 500 SPX.\\nThe Research Affiliates report specifically cited sales per share, so we looked back at the companies' past six full fiscal years to show five-year growth rates for sales per share. Then for additional information that might be of use to readers researching individual stocks, we looked ahead at projected sales-per-share growth rates for the current and following two fiscal years.\\nHere are the 20 stocks in the S&P showing the highest compound annual growth rates  for sales or revenue per share  over the past five full fiscal years:\\nCompany                             Ticker   Five-year SPS CAGR \\n   Moderna Inc.

What we have above is a snapshot based on the companies' sales per share over the past five full fiscal years.\\nSo let's look ahead using consensus estimates among analysts polled by FactSet to see what type of sales growth pace may be in store for these companies.\\nLeaving the group in the same order, here are projected SPS CAGR from the most recent completed fiscal year, market year zero, through the next three fiscal years.

It\\u2019s everything around it.\\nI rarely see AI projects fail because the model is weak. They fail in the plumbing around it. Data pipelines, connectors and environment drift create the most drag.\\nThat is why our team tested Sinapsis. We could sketch a workflow visually, then switch to the Python API without rebuilding anything. That continuity is where so many tools fall apart.\\nFor those of you who have pushed AI into production, which part of the integration stack slows you down the most?\\nSee why Sinapsis was built specifically to eliminate that friction\\nChina and USA dominated the AI papers at NeurIPS 2025!\\nNeurIPS 2025 delivered breakthroughs across scaling, reasoning, RL, memory architectures, self-supervision, diffusion, and biological modeling. Below is our curated list of the 15 papers worth your time plus\\nwhy each one actually matters\\nfor the future of AI.\\n\\ud83c\\udfc6 Award-Winning & Foundational Papers\\n1. Faster R-CNN (Test of Time Award)\\nIntroduced Region Proposal Networks and popularized end-to-end trainable object detection.\\nWhy it matters:\\nThis architecture set the foundation for a decade of breakthroughs in vision, powering early autonomous driving, detection systems, and research benchmarks. Its recognition today shows how crucial architectural simplicity + shared computation still are.\\n2.\\nArtificial Hivemind: The Open-Ended Homogeneity of LMs\\nShows that LLMs tend to converge toward similar answers a phenomenon of diversity collapse.\\nWhy it matters:\\nAs AI becomes widely deployed, homogeneity can create systemic risks, reduce creativity, and amplify cultural bias. Understanding hivemind behavior is essential for safety, personalization, and model diversity.\\n3.\\nOptimal Mistake Bounds for Transductive Online Learning\\nSettles a 30-year question around the value of unlabeled data in online learning.\\nWhy it matters:\\nProvides mathematically tight guarantees that guide the next generation of semi-supervised and active learning systems. This could reduce training cost dramatically for enterprise and low-data domains.\\n4.\\nGated Attention for LLMs\\nAdds a simple sigmoid gate after SDPA to boost performance and long-context stability.\\nWhy it matters:\\nOffers a lightweight alternative to complex attention rewrites like MHA variants or RoPE hacks. If widely adopted, it could meaningfully extend context windows and improve reliability with minimal compute overhead.\\nThe moment you encounter a dataset with no clue about its creator or purpose, the underlying issue becomes clear: enterprise data is frequently passed down without context, full of inconsistencies, and guided by undocumented rules.\\nI\\u2019ve been testing Sema4.ai\\u2019s DataFrames on the kind of datasets that usually take hours just to stabilize. What stood out was how quickly it moved from a natural-language question to something I could use. It generated SQL that made sense, and everything ran locally.\\nThe lightbulb moment was when I joined a few million rows from sources I usually ignore because the effort is too much. This time it ran cleanly without writing code, and the results fed directly into the agent workflows I was building.\\nIt felt like a tool designed for how chaotic real data work can be.\\nIf you\\u2019re dealing with scattered or half-documented data, this is worth exploring.\\n\\u2705 Sema4.ai/DataFrames\\n\\ud83d\\udd2c Scaling, Dynamics & Deep Insights\\n5.\\nSuperposition Yields Robust Neural Scaling\\nShows that scaling laws naturally emerge from strong superposition.\\nWhy it matters:\\nHelps explain\\nwhen\\nscaling works and\\nwhy\\nit sometimes breaks unpredictably. This insight can save millions in training budgets by predicting when additional parameters or tokens won\\u2019t yield returns.\\n6.\\nWhy Diffusion Models Don\\u2019t Memorize\\nReveals two phases of diffusion training: generalization \\u2192 memorization.\\nWhy it matters:\\nOffers a principled explanation for why diffusion models avoid overfitting longer than GANs. This could make synthetic data generation safer for private datasets.\\n7.\\nDoes RL Really Incentivize Reasoning in LLMs?\\nFinds RL improves efficiency but rarely creates\\nnew\\nreasoning patterns beyond the base model.\\nWhy it matters:\\nChallenges the hype around \\u201cRL-makes-models-smart.\\u201d Suggests future reasoning improvements may require architectural changes, richer objectives, or multimodal grounding.\\n8.\\n1000-Layer Networks for Self-Supervised RL\\nDemonstrates huge capability gains by scaling depth alone in RL.\\nWhy it matters:\\nSuggests that RL may follow a scaling law trajectory similar to LLMs. Could unlock general-purpose agents that learn complex behaviors without reward engineering.\\n\\ud83e\\udde9 Memory, Architecture & Long-Term Reasoning\\n9\\n. Titans + MIRAS (Google Research)\\nA long-term memory system with a deep MLP that updates itself using \\u201csurprise signals.\\u201d\\nWhy it matters:\\nAddresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in AI today, persistent memory across million-token contexts. This could reshape agents, copilots, and any workload requiring continuity over days/weeks.\\n\\ud83c\\udfa8 Generation, Synthetic Data & Evaluation\\n10.\\nGenerative Data Augmentation (DAR-GDA)\\nA one-step distilled diffusion generator with adversarial alignment and importance reweighting.\\nWhy it matters:\\nEnables high-quality synthetic datasets with much lower compute. Critical for training in domains where real data is scarce, biased, or expensive (e.g., medical, robotics, simulation).\\n11.\\nEvaluating Multiple Models Using Labeled & Unlabeled Data (SSME)\\nA semi-supervised evaluation method modeling prediction\\u2013label relationships.\\nWhy it matters:\\nEvaluation is becoming the new bottleneck in AI. This method makes accurate offline model comparison possible even with limited labels, cheaper, faster, and more robust.\\n\\ud83e\\udde0 Theory, Chaos & Geometric Models\\n12.\\nSlow Transition to Low-Dimensional Chaos in Heavy-Tailed RNNs\\nShows heavy-tailed RNNs behave in fundamentally different ways from Gaussian ones.\\nWhy it matters:\\nProvides clues for designing more brain-like, stable, energy-efficient models. Also helps explain emergent structure and long-range dependencies in real neural systems.\\n13.\\nRiemannian Consistency Model\\nA generalization of consistency models to curved manifolds.\\nWhy it matters:\\nUnlocks generation on non-Euclidean spaces, a big deal for robotics, protein folding, 3D geometry, and rotations. It expands generative modeling beyond the flat world of pixels and vectors.\\n\\ud83e\\uddec Biology, Multimodal Reasoning & Molecular AI\\n14.\\nBioReason\\nConnects a DNA-model backbone with an LLM for multimodal biological reasoning.\\nWhy it matters:\\nPushes AI deeper into interpretable genomics, an increasingly critical field. Could accelerate target discovery, diagnostics, and drug reasoning workflows.\\n\\ud83d\\udef0\\ufe0f Robotics, SLAM & Dynamic Environments\\n15.\\nNFL-BA: Near-Field Light Bundle Adjustment for SLAM\\nModels near-field lighting correctly for SLAM in dynamic or reflective environments.\\nWhy it matters:\\nTraditional SLAM fails under complex lighting, exactly the conditions found in endoscopy, low-light robotics, and AR. This closes a key gap toward robust real-world autonomous systems.\\nAI Frontier\\nAI Frontier\\n855,429 followers\\n+ Subscribe\\nLike\\nComment\\nCopy\\nLinkedIn\\nFacebook\\nX\\nShare\\n263\\n7 Comments\\nPramuka Weerasinghe\\n5d\\nReport this comment\\nGreat insights of some brilliant research\\nLike\\nReply\\n1\\u00a0Reaction\\nHr Dr. Takahisa Karita\\nTop Entrepreneurs Setting New Standards in Their Industry in 2025 by USA Today.

Serving a total of almost 14 years, Rutte is the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history.\\nAfter originally embarking on a business management career working for\\nUnilever\\n, Rutte entered national politics in 2002 as a member of\\nJan Peter Balkenende\\n's cabinet. Rutte won the\\n2006 VVD leadership election\\nand led the party to victory in the\\n2010 general election\\n. After lengthy\\ncoalition negotiations\\n, he became prime minister of the Netherlands. He was the first self-described\\nliberal\\nto be appointed prime minister in 92 years.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAn impasse on budget negotiations led to his government's early collapse in April 2012, but the VVD's victory in the\\nsubsequent election\\nallowed Rutte to return as prime minister to lead\\nhis second cabinet\\nbetween the VVD and the\\nLabour Party\\n(PvdA), which became the first cabinet to complete a full four-year term since 1998. Though the VVD lost seats in the\\n2017 general election\\n, it remained the largest party. After a record-length formation period, Rutte was appointed to lead\\nhis third cabinet\\nbetween the VVD,\\nChristian Democratic Appeal\\n(CDA),\\nDemocrats 66\\n(D66) and\\nChristian Union\\n(CU).\\nThough Rutte and his cabinet resigned in response to the\\nDutch childcare benefits scandal\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nthe VVD would go on to win the\\n2021 general election\\n.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nRutte began his fourth term in 2022 after another record-length formation period. On 7 July 2023, he announced his government's resignation after the cabinet failed to agree on how to handle\\nmigration\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nRutte IV would continue on as an outgoing cabinet, fulfilling a caretaker function and keeping the nation running until the\\nSchoof cabinet\\nwas sworn in on 2 July 2024.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nFor his ability to remain in office until 2024 despite various political scandals,\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nRutte had been referred to as '\\nTeflon\\nMark' as \\\"nothing ever seemed to stick to him\\\".\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nHe has also been described by the\\nForeign Policy\\ncolumnist Caroline de Gruyter as ideologically flexible and pragmatic, willing to accommodate a broad range of political factions in order to address issues,\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nwhile the\\nGuardian\\ncorrespondent Jon Henley sees in him a \\\"managerial rather than a visionary leader\\\".\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nEarly life\\nRutte was born in\\nThe Hague\\n, in the\\nprovince\\nof\\nSouth Holland\\n,\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nto a\\nDutch Reformed\\nfamily. He is the youngest child of Iza\\u00e4k Rutte (5 October 1909 \\u2013 22 April 1988), a merchant, and his second wife Hermina Cornelia Dilling (13 November 1923 \\u2013 13 May 2020), a secretary. Iza\\u00e4k Rutte worked for a\\ntrading company\\n; first as an importer in the\\nDutch East Indies\\n; he later ran a car dealership.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nHis second wife was a sister of his first wife, Petronella Hermanna Dilling (17 March 1910 \\u2013 20 July 1945), who died while they were interned together in\\nTjideng\\n, a prisoner-of-war camp in\\nBatavia\\n(present-day\\nJakarta\\n, Indonesia), during\\nWorld War II\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nRutte has seven siblings as a result of his father's two marriages. One of his elder brothers died from AIDS in the 1980s. Rutte later described the deaths of his brother and his father as events that changed the course of his life.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nRutte attended the Maerlant Lyceum from 1979 until 1985,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nspecialising in the arts. Although his original ambition was to attend a conservatory and become a concert pianist,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nhe instead went to study history at\\nLeiden University\\n, where he obtained an\\nMA\\ndegree in 1992.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nRutte combined his studies with a position on the board of the\\nYouth Organisation Freedom and Democracy\\n, the youth organisation of the VVD, and served as chair of the organisation from 1988 to 1991.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nAfter his studies Rutte entered the business world, working as a manager for\\nUnilever\\nand its food subsidiary Calv\\u00e9. Until 1997, Rutte was part of the\\nhuman resource\\ndepartment of Unilever, and played a leading role in several reorganisations. Between 1997 and 2000, Rutte was staff manager of the subsidiary Van den Bergh Nederland. In 2000, Rutte became a member of the Corporate Human Resources Group, and in 2002, he became human resource manager for IgloMora Groep, another subsidiary of Unilever.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nPolitical career\\nBetween 1993 and 1997, Rutte was a member of the national board of the VVD.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nRutte served as State Secretary (i.e. Deputy Minister) at the\\nSocial Affairs and Employment Ministry\\nfrom 22 July 2002 to 17 June 2004 in the\\nFirst\\nand\\nSecond Balkenende cabinets\\nand was responsible for fields including\\nbijstand\\n(\\nmunicipal welfare\\n) and\\narbeidsomstandigheden\\n(\\nOccupational safety and health\\n). After the\\n2003 elections\\nRutte was briefly also a member of the\\nHouse of Representatives\\n, from 30 January to 27 May 2003.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 2003, Rutte supported the US-led\\ninvasion of Iraq\\n.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nDuring his time as State Secretary in 2003, Rutte advised municipalities to check Somali residents for social assistance fraud, after a number of Somalis who were working in England were found to be receiving social assistance benefits in the Netherlands as well. A Somali man entitled to benefits was stopped by social investigators and checked for fraud on the basis of his external characteristics, after which he refused the investigators access to his home. The Municipal Executive (\\nCollege van burgemeester en wethouders\\n) of\\nHaarlem\\ndecided to withdraw his right to social benefits. He disagreed with this and his appeal was upheld by the administrative judge. The court ruled that \\\"an investigation aimed exclusively at persons of Somali descent is discriminatory\\\" and contrary to the Constitution because this distinction is \\\"discrimination based on race\\\". Rutte rejected the criticism, stating that a change in the law would then be necessary to be able to combat targeted fraud.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nRutte later served as State Secretary for Higher Education and Science within the\\nEducation, Culture and Science Ministry\\nin the Second Balkenende Cabinet from 17 June 2004 to 27 June 2006, replacing\\nAnnette Nijs\\n. In office, Rutte showed particular interest in making the\\nDutch higher education system\\nmore competitive internationally, by trying to make it more market oriented (improving the position of students as consumers in the market for education). Rutte resigned from his position in government in June 2006 to return to the\\nHouse of Representatives\\n, and he soon became the\\nparliamentary leader\\nof the VVD.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nParty leadership election\\nAfter the resignation of\\nJozias van Aartsen\\nand a loss in the 2006 Dutch municipal election, the VVD held an\\ninternal election\\nfor a new Lead Candidate, in which Rutte competed against\\nRita Verdonk\\nand\\nJelleke Veenendaal\\n. On 31 May 2006, it was announced that Mark Rutte would be the next\\nlijsttrekker\\nof the VVD. He was elected by 51.5% of party members. Rutte's candidacy was backed by the VVD leadership, including the party board, and many prominent politicians such as\\nFrank de Grave\\n, former minister of Defence,\\nIvo Opstelten\\n, the mayor of\\nRotterdam\\nand\\nEd Nijpels\\n, the\\nQueen's Commissioner\\nof\\nFriesland\\n. The\\nYouth Organisation Freedom and Democracy\\n, the VVD's youth wing of which Rutte had previously been chair, also backed him. During the elections he promised \\\"to make the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy a party for everyone and not just of the elite\\\".\\n2006 general election\\nFor the\\n2006 general election\\n, the VVD campaign with Rutte as leader did not get off to a good start; he received criticism from within his own party.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nRutte was said to be overshadowed by his own party members\\nRita Verdonk\\nand\\nGerrit Zalm\\n, as well as being unable to penetrate between\\nWouter Bos\\nand\\nJan Peter Balkenende\\n, who were generally seen as the prime candidates to become the next prime minister. On 27 November, it became known that Rita Verdonk, who generally held a more populist view on politics, managed to obtain more votes than Mark Rutte; he obtained 553,200 votes against Verdonk's 620,555.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nAfter repeated criticisms by Verdonk on VVD policy, Rutte expelled her from the party's parliamentary faction on 13 September 2007.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\n2010 general election\\nIn the\\n2010 general election\\n, Rutte was once again the lead candidate for the VVD. It won 31 seats and, for the first time ever, became the largest party in the House of Representatives.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nThe lengthy\\n2010 cabinet formation\\nfollowed, with several personalities succeeding each other, being appointed by\\nQueen Beatrix\\nin order to find out what coalition could be formed. Efforts to form a broad spectrum coalition between the VVD, CDA and PvdA failed. Instead, the only possibility appeared to be a centre-right coalition of liberals and\\nChristian Democrats\\n(CDA), with the outside support of the\\nParty for Freedom\\n(PVV), led by\\nGeert Wilders\\n.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nPrime Minister of the Netherlands\\nPremiership of Mark Rutte\\n14 October 2010\\u00a0\\u2013 2 July 2024\\nPrime\\u00a0Minister\\nMark Rutte\\nCabinet\\nFirst Rutte cabinet\\nSecond Rutte cabinet\\nThird Rutte cabinet\\nFourth Rutte cabinet\\nParty\\nPeople's Party for Freedom and Democracy\\nElection\\n2010\\n,\\n2012\\n,\\n2017\\n,\\n2021\\nAppointed by\\nBeatrix of the Netherlands\\nWillem-Alexander of the Netherlands\\nSeat\\nTorentje\\n\\u2190\\nJan Peter Balkenende\\nDick Schoof\\n\\u2192\\nFirst term\\nRutte presenting his first cabinet together with Deputy Prime Minister\\nMaxime Verhagen\\n(CDA) and coalition partner\\nGeert Wilders\\n(PVV)\\nAfter securing support for a coalition between the VVD and CDA, Rutte was appointed as\\nformateur\\non 8 October 2010; Rutte announced his prospective cabinet, including\\nMaxime Verhagen\\nfrom the CDA as deputy prime minister. On 14 October, Queen Beatrix formally invited Rutte to form a government, and later that day, Rutte presented his\\nfirst cabinet\\nto Parliament. The government was confirmed in office by a majority of one, and Rutte was sworn in as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, becoming the first Liberal to serve in the role since\\nPieter Cort van der Linden\\nin 1918.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nAt 43 years old, he also became the second-youngest prime minister in Dutch history, after\\nRuud Lubbers\\n.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nNord Stream 1\\nopening ceremony on 8 November 2011 with Rutte, German Chancellor\\nAngela Merkel\\n, Russian president\\nDmitry Medvedev\\nand French prime minister\\nFran\\u00e7ois Fillon\\n.\\nAfter a victory in the\\n2011 provincial elections\\n, the VVD secured its status as the lead party within the government. In March 2012, seeking to comply with requirements from the\\nEuropean Union\\nto reduce the nation's deficit, Rutte began talks with his coalition partners on a budget which would cut 16 billion euros of government spending. However, PVV leader\\nGeert Wilders\\nwithdrew his party's informal support from the government on 21 April, stating that the proposed budget would hurt economic growth.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nThis led to the early collapse of the government and Rutte submitting his resignation to\\nQueen Beatrix\\non the afternoon of 23 April.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nHis government had lasted for 558 days, making it one of the shortest Dutch cabinets since World War II.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nSecond term\\nAhead of the\\n2012 general election\\n, Rutte was named the VVD's\\nlead candidate\\nfor the third time. At the election in September, the VVD won an additional 10 seats, remaining the largest party in the House of Representatives; the CDA and PVV saw their number of seats fall significantly.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nThe VVD quickly negotiated a coalition agreement with the\\nLabour Party\\nand Rutte returned as prime minister of the\\nSecond Rutte cabinet\\non 5 November 2012.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nIn 2014,\\nThe Hague\\nhosted a\\nGroup of Seven\\nspecial meeting after the\\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17\\nwas shot down in Ukraine with 193 Dutch nationals aboard.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nRutte with Israeli prime minister\\nBenjamin Netanyahu\\n, 8 December 2013\\nIn April 2016, Rutte was appointed by\\nUnited Nations Secretary-General\\nBan Ki-moon\\nand\\nPresident of the World Bank Group\\nJim Yong Kim\\nto the High-Level Panel on Water. Co-chaired by Mauritius President\\nAmeenah Gurib\\nand Mexican president\\nEnrique Pe\\u00f1a Nieto\\n, the joint UN-WBG panel was set up to accelerate the implementation of\\nSustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)\\n.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nThat month also saw the controversial\\n2016 Dutch Ukraine\\u2013European Union Association Agreement referendum\\n, which resulted in a rejection. In November 2016 the House of Representatives approved a ban on the Islamic\\nburqa\\nin some public spaces including schools and hospitals by 132 votes against 18, which the VVD supported.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nRutte's second cabinet completed its full four-year term without collapsing or losing a vote of no confidence, becoming the first cabinet to do so since the\\nFirst Kok cabinet\\n, which lasted from 1994 to 1998.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nThird term\\nThe VVD went into the\\n2017 general election\\nwith a small lead over the PVV in most opinion polls. Rutte was judged to have managed the\\n2017 Dutch\\u2013Turkish diplomatic incident\\nwell according to similar polling. While the VVD lost 8 seats in the general election, the PvdA lost 29, and these seats were split between a number of other parties, leaving the VVD as the largest party in parliament for the third successive election. After holding coalition discussions, Rutte negotiated a grand coalition with the\\nCDA\\n,\\nD66\\nand\\nCU\\n; he presented his\\nthird cabinet\\non 26 October 2017 and was sworn in as prime minister for a third term. The 225 days between the general election and the installation of the third Rutte cabinet was the longest such period in Dutch history.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nRutte with Indian prime minister\\nNarendra Modi\\n, 24 May 2018\\nThe coalition agreement contained a plan to abolish the 15%\\ndividend tax\\n(providing the state \\u20ac1.4 billion per year), which proved highly unpopular as it had not been mentioned in any of the coalition party's programs, and it later appeared that major Dutch companies like\\nShell\\nand\\nUnilever\\nhad secretly been lobbying for the inclusion of this measure.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nOn 21 March 2018, the\\nDutch Intelligence and Security Services Act referendum\\nwas held, which resulted in a rejection. In July of that same year, Rutte became a topic in international news by interrupting and explicitly contradicting the American president\\nDonald Trump\\nduring a meeting with the press at the\\nOval Office\\nin the\\nWhite House\\n, which was considered to be \\\"typical Dutch bluntness\\\".\\n[\\n45\\n]\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nAt the\\n2019 provincial elections\\n, Rutte's VVD suffered a blow following the victory of right-wing populist newcomer\\nForum for Democracy\\n(FvD).\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nRutte with U.S. president\\nDonald Trump\\nin the Oval Office of the White House on 18 July 2019\\nDuring the negotiations for the\\nCOVID-19 recovery fund in the European Union\\nin 2020, Rutte was considered the unofficial leader of the\\nFrugal Four\\n,\\n[\\n48\\n]\\ndemanding loans instead of grants and more conditions on them.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nIn September of that year, Rutte suggested that the EU could be dissolved and re-formed without\\nPoland\\nand\\nHungary\\n, as he perceived these countries' governments to be dismantling the\\nrule of law\\n.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nOn 15 January 2021, the third Rutte cabinet collectively resigned after the publication of research centered around the\\nchildcare subsidies scandal in the Netherlands\\n.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nRutte offered his resignation to\\nKing Willem-Alexander\\n, accepting responsibility for the scandal.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nFourth term\\nRutte and U.S. president\\nJoe Biden\\nat the\\nG20 Rome summit\\n, 31 October 2021\\nRutte with Ukrainian president\\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy\\n, 11 July 2022\\nRutte with Azerbaijani President\\nIlham Aliyev\\n, 19 January 2023\\nRutte with European Commission President\\nUrsula von der Leyen\\n, Italian prime minister\\nGiorgia Meloni\\nand Tunisian president\\nKais Saied\\n, 16 July 2023\\nFollowing the\\n2021 Dutch general election\\n, Rutte's VVD party held 34 of 150 seats and was expected to form a new coalition government.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nAfter remaining as outgoing prime minister for the duration of the longest formation process in Dutch history he presented a coalition agreement with\\nD66\\n,\\nCDA\\nand\\nCU\\n, the same combination as his previous government, on 15 December 2021.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nIn October 2022, Rutte said that alleged\\nwar crimes\\nand human rights violations committed during the\\nArmenian-Azerbaijani war\\nin\\nNagorno-Karabakh\\nshould be investigated.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nRutte suffered a\\npolitical scandal\\n(\\nNokiagate\\n) during his fourth term, when it was found that he had been deleting the majority of the SMS text messages on his archaic\\nNokia\\nmobile phone for years, personally judging which messages were to be archived and which messages were to be deleted in direct violation of the archival law.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nHe explained that this was necessary due to his phone memory filling up too quickly, which was not considered a plausible excuse by other ministers.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nThe scandal also damaged his campaign promises and the coalition accords, which stated that the cabinet wished to restore peoples faith in politics, create a new governance culture and \\\"improve the information provided to the House\\\". The latter of these concerned measures including a modernisation of the archival law and faster information availability.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nIn January 2023, the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands reached an agreement to limit certain\\nadvanced chip exports to China\\n.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nAccordingly, the Dutch government placed restrictions on chip exports in March 2023 in order to protect national security. This measure affected the Dutch multinational\\nASML\\n, one of the most important companies in the global microchip supply chain.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nIn January 2024, the Dutch government placed further restrictions on the shipment of some advanced chip-making equipment to China,\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nthough on 27 March 2024, Chinese president\\nXi Jinping\\ntold Rutte that \\\"no force can stop the pace of China\\u2019s scientific and technological progress\\\".\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nDifferent stances on\\nimmigration policy\\nwithin his four-party coalition had existed since the coalition government was formed. VVD and CDA supported restrictions on immigration, while D66 and CU opposed them. On 7 July 2023, the parties failed to reach an agreement and unanimously decided that they could not continue working together within the coalition. Following this, Rutte immediately offered the resignation of his government.\\n[\\n63\\n]\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nThe king asked that the prime minister and his government \\\"continue to carry out the duties they consider necessary to the interests of the Kingdom in a caretaker capacity\\\".\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nThree days later, Rutte announced his departure both as political leader of the VVD and from national politics in general, after the installation of the next government.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nWhile serving as outgoing prime minister, Rutte he condemned the\\nOctober 7 attacks\\nin 2023 and expressed his support to\\nIsrael\\nand its right to self-defense.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nNotably, he was the first foreign leader to speak with Israeli prime minister\\nBenjamin Netanyahu\\non that day.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nLater that same month he visited Israel to express solidarity with the country, meeting with Netanyahu in Jerusalem.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nHe rejected calls for a ceasefire in the\\nGaza war\\nbut supported \\\"humanitarian pauses\\\" to provide aid to civilians in the\\nGaza Strip\\n.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nThough the Netherlands provided military aid to Israel, in February 2024 a court in the Netherlands ordered the Dutch government to stop exporting parts for\\nF-35\\nfighter jets to the country.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nDue to the resignation of the cabinet general elections were held early, on\\n22 November 2023\\n, with the VVD now under the leadership of\\nDilan Ye\\u015filg\\u00f6z\\n.\\nIn February 2024, Rutte visited\\nSaudi Arabia\\nand spoke with the Saudi crown prince\\nMohammed bin Salman\\nabout \\\"broad cooperation\\\".\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nHe would travel to Paris on 26 February, where\\nEmmanuel Macron\\nwas hosting an emergency summit concerning the situation in\\nUkraine\\n, which had suffered the loss of\\nAvdiivka\\ndue to a lack of available ammunition. Czech PM\\nPetr Fiala\\nproposed to purchase 500,000 rounds of artillery ammunition for\\nVolodymyr Zelensky\\n's forces. This was the second time in one month the Czech government had aired the matter. The French had previously vetoed the idea to purchase the ammunition from foreign sources.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nOn behalf of his government, Rutte announced that they would provide \\u20ac100 million for this purpose.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nOn 1 March Rutte increased the commitment to \\u20ac250 million for Fiala's venture, as he went to\\nKharkiv\\nto tour an underground metro station that had been repurposed into a primary school together with Zelensky.

Rutte said that \\\"this is a direct security threat for us, because if Russia will be successful in Ukraine, it will be a threat to the whole of Europe.

The two players would further compliment the Irving\\u2013Don\\u010di\\u0107 backcourt by significantly reinforcing the team's defense into a powerhouse. The trade has been regarded as the catalyst for the Mavericks morphing into championship contenders by the next month.

The Mavericks won the series in six games.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nIn the second round they faced the first-seeded\\nOklahoma City Thunder\\n.

Joseph Homer Parker founded a private women's\\nCongregational\\npreparatory school which was supported mainly by Wichita's Plymouth Congregational Church, Parker's church. The school never opened its doors.\\nCalled the \\\"Young Ladies College,\\\" \\\"Wichita Ladies College\\\" and \\\"Congregational Female College\\\" and founded during a boom in college and university creation, the private school was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older. In early 1887, the project's leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and, in response, renamed their school\\nFairmount College\\n. Envisioned to be the \\\"Vassar of the West,\\\" the streets of the neighboring residential areas were named after prominent women's colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. The street names remain in 2023.\\nIn 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school\\nFairmount Institute\\n. Also known as Fairmount Academy, this Congregational church prep school opened in September to boys and girls age 12 and above.\\nIn 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. The society selected Nathan Jackson Morrison to be the president of the new college.\\nDuring the 1900s and 1910s, the school grew with structures including a men's dormitory, Fiske Hall, begun in 1904 and dedicated June 1906, and a Carnegie library, built in 1908, occupied in January 1909 and dedicated in January 1910.\\nFairmount trustees decided to phase out and eventually close the institute after the 1915 school year. For 20 years, students of the institute formed the nucleus of Fairmount College's student body.\\nThe school's mascot, the \\\"wheatshockers,\\\" came about during a football game in 1906 and referred to the fact that many of the football players also shocked wheat during the harvest.\\nAmid growing financial troubles in the 1920s, the college's supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the\\nMunicipal University of Wichita\\n(popularly known as \\\"Wichita University\\\" or \\\"WU\\\"). It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi.\\nBy the 1950s, university leaders and President Harry Corbin explored adding the institution to the State of Kansas Regents System along with the University of Kansas and Kansas State University. These two schools had powerful friends who did not feel that the University of Wichita was on par with the state's two main universities. It took a concerted lobbying effort on the part of WU boosters to persuade the legislature and governor to agree to the change. On July 1, 1964, the school officially entered the state system of higher education as Wichita State University.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nLocated on campus is the original building of the first Pizza Hut. The original building was located at Kellogg and Bluff. An effort to move it out of the path of Kellogg expansion resulted in the building coming to Wichita State University in the 1980s. After three decades of being located near the campus water tower, the building underwent a second move. In 2017, the university moved it to its current location on the Innovation Campus.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nCampuses\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe main campus is located at 1845 North Fairmount in northeast Wichita, is mostly bounded between the streets of 17th St N, 21st St N, Hillside St, Oliver Ave. The Hughes Metropolitan Complex and Advanced Education in General Dentistry buildings, located at the intersection of 29th St N and Oliver Ave, are considered part of the main campus.  There are seven satellite campuses.\\nSince July 1, 2018, the\\nCampus of Applied Sciences and Technology\\n, also known as \\\"WSU Tech\\\" and formerly known as the Wichita Area Technical College, is located at 4004 N.

The plan kicked off with the completion of renovations to the university's student union, the Rhatigan Student Center, and the opening of Shocker Hall, a new 318,000-square-foot, 784-bed housing facility on the main campus. Subsequent development has taken place on the site of the former Braeburn Golf Course, a WSU-owned course adjacent to campus which closed in November 2014.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nGround broke on the first building, the Technology Transfer/Experiential Learning Building, in Q1 2015.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nThe university has secured on-campus partnerships with multiple companies including Sunnyvale, Calif.-based\\nNetApp\\n, which moved its entire Wichita operations into a new building on campus;\\nAirbus\\n;\\nDeloitte\\n;\\nTextron Aviation\\n;\\nBoston Consulting Group\\n; and\\nDassault Syst\\u00e8mes\\nto name a few.

Also, it offers club sports such as crew, bowling, shooting sports, and other intramural sports.\\nShockers\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe name for WSU's athletic teams is the Shockers and students are also collectively referred to as \\\"Shockers.\\\" The name reflects the university's heritage: Early students earned money by shocking, or harvesting, wheat in nearby fields. Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nAlthough the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol. WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society's competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school.  The October 7, 1948, issue of\\nThe Sunflower\\n, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school's new mascot. The winning name was \\\"WuShock.\\\"\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nDuring the 1980s, WuShock briefly had a sidekick named WeeShock, that was introduced as an attempt to make the mascot more appealing to children.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nIn 1998,\\nWuShock\\n, also referred to as \\\"Wu,\\\" marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot's costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school's logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help. Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU's image.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nBasketball\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCharles Koch Arena\\nis home to the\\nWichita State Shockers\\nmen's\\nand women's basketball and women's volleyball teams.

He is the current head coach of\\nQatar Stars League\\nside\\nAl Duhail\\n.

He also briefly played in\\nLa Liga\\nfor\\nCelta Vigo\\nand in the\\nPremier League\\nfor\\nManchester City\\n. Later on in his career he returned to\\nEngland\\nand played several seasons at\\nSouthampton\\nwhilst the club were in the\\nFootball League\\n. He also played for\\nMartigues\\n,\\nAl-Ittihad\\nand\\nAl-Kharitiyath\\n. Born in\\nFrance\\n, he played internationally for\\nAlgeria\\nand was capped 20 times.\\nAs a coach, Belmadi has managed\\nLekhwiya\\n,\\nQatar B\\n,\\nQatar\\n,\\nAl-Duhail\\n[\\na\\n]\\nand most recently, Algeria.\\nClub career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nFrance and Spain\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBorn in\\nChampigny-sur-Marne\\n, France, Belmadi started his career at\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n, making his debut in January 1996 against\\nGueugnon\\n, before spending a season at\\nMartigues\\n. He spent the 1997\\u201398 season at\\nMarseille\\n, and then moved to\\nCannes\\nfor the 1998\\u201399 season. In August 1999, he was signed again by Marseille, but immediately went on loan to Spanish club\\nCelta Vigo\\n.\\nIn January 2000, Belmadi returned to Marseille, eventually securing a regular place in the first team's midfield in 2000\\u201301. In January 2001, he made good use of a rare opportunity presented him to play in Marseille's attack, when Liberian maestro\\nGeorge Weah\\n\\u2014who had been the main attacker\\u2014was away on international duty with the Lone Stars of\\nLiberia\\n. Belmadi seized the opportunity to score a vital goal for Marseille against fellow strugglers\\nToulouse\\nto keep Marseille just outside the relegation zone.\\nOn 14 April 2001, he scored the winning goal in Marseille's 2\\u20131 victory over\\nSedan\\n, before a near\\u201360,000 crowd, giving\\nBernard Tapie\\n's team a much needed lifeline out of relegation.\\nManchester City\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn January 2003, Belmadi had fallen out of favour at Marseille, now managed by\\nAlain Perrin\\n, who agreed to loan him to\\nKevin Keegan\\n\\u2019s\\nManchester City\\nafter a successful trial. He joined ranks with fellow Algerian\\nAli Benarbia\\n.\\nHe made his full debut for Manchester City on 29 January 2003 at\\nMaine Road\\nin a 4\\u20131 victory against\\nFulham\\n(alongside another recruit from the French league \\u2013\\nDavid Sommeil\\n).\\nIn Belmadi's brief time at Manchester City, he only made two starts and six substitute appearances, the last of which was in a  1\\u20130 defeat against\\nSouthampton\\non 11 May 2003 in the final league game at Maine Road.\\nAlthough Kevin Keegan liked Belmadi's style of play, he conceded that he could not afford another free spirit in a side already containing\\nEyal Berkovic\\nand Ali Bernabia, so Belmadi returned to Marseille.\\nIn August 2003, he was released by Marseille and played the 2003\\u201304 and 2004\\u201305 seasons in\\nQatar\\nwith\\nAl-Ittihad\\nand\\nAl-Kharitiyath\\n.\\nSouthampton\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn July 2005, after trials at\\nCeltic\\n,\\nWigan Athletic\\nand\\nSunderland\\n, Belmadi joined\\nSouthampton\\n(then playing in the Football League Championship) for their pre-season tour of Scotland.\\nHarry Redknapp\\ninitially gave Belmadi a one-month contract, and he made his debut on 6 August 2005 in a 0\\u20130 draw against\\nWolverhampton Wanderers\\n. His contract was extended until the end of the 2005\\u201306 season after impressive performances in his early games, including a goal against\\nCrewe Alexandra\\non 27 August 2005. In January 2006, he picked up a thigh injury, which put him out of the team until April.\\nBelmadi had, however, done enough to persuade Southampton, now managed by\\nGeorge Burley\\n, to re-sign him for the 2006\\u201307 season. This was again blighted by injury problems, including a knee injury picked up in September, which put him out until February. He picked up several other niggling injuries putting him out for long periods. When fit, there was no doubting Belmadi's ability and quality on the ball whether playing on the left or right of midfield. At his best, he could unpick defenses with his passing and kept the ball well. Unfortunately, his injuries restricted him to 40 appearances in his two years at\\nSt Mary's\\n. His contract with the Saints expired on 30 June 2007 and was not renewed as Southampton faced up to the financial realities of a third season in\\nthe Championship\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nValenciennes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAfter being released by Southampton, Belmadi returned to France and joined\\nValenciennes\\n. He retired from football in 2009.\\nInternational career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBelmadi made his debut for\\nAlgeria\\non 9 July 2000 against\\nMorocco\\n. He was part of the Algerian\\n2004 African Nations Cup\\nteam, who finished second in their group in the first round of competition before being defeated by Morocco in the quarter-finals. Belmadi last played for Algeria in a World Cup qualifier against\\nZimbabwe\\non 20 June 2004, having made 20 appearances and scoring 5 goals.\\nManagerial career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nLekhwiya\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBelmadi coaching Lekhwiya in a\\nQatar Stars League\\nmatch against\\nAl Sadd\\nIn the summer of 2010, Belmadi was appointed as the head coach of newly promoted\\nQatar Stars League\\nclub\\nLekhwiya\\n.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nIn his first season with the club, he led them to the\\n2010\\u201311 Qatar Stars League\\ntitle for the first time in the club's history.

He led his team to a notable 1\\u20130 first-ever victory over\\nAustralia\\nin a friendly match on 14 October 2014, after having posted a 5\\u20130 win over\\nLebanon\\nand a 3\\u20130 victory over\\nUzbekistan\\nin their two previous matches.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nIn correspondence to Qatar's performance in the aforementioned friendly matches, sports channel\\nAl Kass\\nstated that Qatar is \\\"showing signs of evolution with Belmadi\\\" and that the team was \\\"undergoing a renewal.\\\"\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nHe led Qatar to win the\\n22nd Arabian Gulf Cup\\nby beating host\\nSaudi Arabia\\nin the final. However, Qatar showed a poor form in the\\n2015 AFC Asian Cup\\nand was eliminated in the group stages after three consecutive defeats by\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\n,\\nIran\\nand\\nBahrain\\n. He was dismissed from his post on 30 April 2015.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nAl-Duhail\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOn 19 June 2015, Belmadi was appointed for the second time in his career to coach\\nLekhwiya\\n; he was a replacement for\\nMichael Laudrup\\n.

The unimpressive qualification campaign increased the pressure on Belmadi.\\nDespite heavy criticism, Belmadi led Algeria to success and earned his first international trophy. Algeria defeated every opponent on its road to the final of the\\n2019 Africa Cup of Nations\\n(AFCON) held in Egypt, including two victories over\\nSenegal\\nin the group stage and the\\nfinal\\n. Algeria won its second continental title and became the North African second team, after\\nEgypt\\n, to win more than one AFCON trophy.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIn the\\n2021 AFCON\\n, the defending champions Algeria finished last in their group to be eliminated from the tournament.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nDuring the\\n2022 World Cup qualification\\nthird round, Algeria failed to qualify to the final tournament in Qatar, having lost on away goals rule against\\nCameroon\\nfollowing a 2\\u20132 draw on aggregate.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nIn January 2023, Belmadi extended his contract until 2026.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn the\\n2023 AFCON\\nheld in\\nIvory Coast\\n, Algeria led by Belmadi exited the tournament after their defeat against\\nMauritania\\n, without scoring any win in the group phase.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nOn 24 January 2024, Belmadi's position as national team manager was terminated by mutual consent.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nHowever, despite immediately resigning himself in front of the players, Belmadi asked the\\nFAF\\nfor a severance package worth 29 months of salary, equivalent to \\u20ac7 million.

The Croat reigned supreme at the 2024 Hangzhou Open, beating Zhang Zhizhen 7-6(5), 7-6(5) in the final to win the 21st title of his career in singles.\\nAd\\nCilic started the tournament as the World No. 777, the result of a long injury break from the tour. Coming back from knee surgery just last month, he played in a couple of Challenger events before returning to the ATP Tour at Hangzhou with a wildcard.\\nExpand Tweet\\nAd\\nTrending\\nIn his opener, Cilic took down Zachary Svajda, and he followed that with a win over Yoshihito Nishioka in the second round. Then, he defeated Yasutaka Uchiyama to move into the semifinals, where he overcame fourth seed Brandon Nakashima to reach the summit clash.\\nExpand Tweet\\nAd\\nMarin Cilic's last title came back in 2021 when he won the Stuttgart Open on grass. He began his 2022 season at the Tata Open Maharashtra but had to withdraw from the tournament midway as his knee troubles resurfaced.\\nCilic has already risen several places and is currently ranked World No. 373 this week. With the ATP 250 title, he is set to rise even higher; the Croat is sitting at No. 212 in the live rankings.\\nAd\\nIt should be noted that because the Hangzhou Open started in the middle of last week, Cilic entered the tournament with the ranking of No. 777, allowing him the chance to make history. Before him, the record was held by former World No. 1\\nLleyton Hewitt\\n, who won the 1998 Adelaide title as the World No. 550.\\nWhere is Marin Cilic in action next?\\nMarin Cilic at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open - Day 3 - Source: Getty\\nFollowing his title win at the Hangzhou Open, Marin Cilic is set to be in action next at the ATP 500 Japan Open. In his opener, he is drawn to take on\\nKei Nishikori\\n, setting up a rematch of their 2014 US Open final, where Cilic prevailed to win his maiden and only Grand Slam title so far.\\nAlso in action at the Japan Open are the likes of Stefanos Tsitsipas, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe, and Taylor Fritz. Fritz, the American No. 1, is the top seed at the tournament, while Hubert Hurkacz is the No. 2 seed. A win against Nishikori would pit Cilic against either Jordan Thompson or third seed\\nCasper Ruud\\nin the second round.\\n\\u00d7\\nWas this article helpful?\\nThank You for feedback\\nQuick Links\\nUS Open Tennis 2025\\nMarin Cilic\\nZhizhen Zhang\\nMen's tennis trending news\\nNewsNow Tennis\\nHas Marin Cilic ever won a Grand Slam?\\nMore from Sportskeeda\\nEdited by Shyam Kamal\\nMore from Sportskeeda\\nFetching more content...\\nWhat's your opinion?\\nPost as Guest\\n*No login required\\nCancel\\nPost\\n1\\n\\u2715\\n\\u2715\\nNo Results Found\\nWWE\\nNBA\\nNFL\\nMMA\\nTennis\\nNHL\\nGolf\\nMLB\\nSoccer\\nF1\\nWNBA\\nMore\\nNCAAF\\nNCAAB\\nNASCAR\\nPopular\\nImportant Links\\nAbout Us\\nWrite For Us\\nPolicies\\nGrievance Redressal\\nEditorial Standards\\nFact Check\\nAffiliate Program\\nCareers\\nCSR\\nPrivacy Policy\\nContact Us\\nManage notifications\"}"}], "step_2": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': 'Marin Cilic, born in Croatia, was the lowest-ranked tennis player to win an ATP Tour title according to the Guinness World Records in 2024.', 'context': 'Marin Cilic made history at the 2024 Hangzhou Open by winning the ATP Tour title while ranked World No. 777, the lowest ranking ever for a title winner.

For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don't come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there's been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They've been ordered from least to most expensive, and we've only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\n10\\nMcLaren W1\\n$2,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,258 hp\\nTorque\\n988 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n2.7 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 399 units\\nIt's been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand's \\\"World Championship\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company's first Driver's and Constructor's World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\nGoogle News\\nFollow On\\nGoogle News\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\nExpand\\nCollapse\\nObviously, there's a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand's famous design language. It's everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\n9\\nBertone GB110\\n$2,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nV8\\nHorsepower\\n1,108 hp\\nTorque\\n811 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-186 mph\\n12.9 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 33\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\nthe design house's first hypercar\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn't worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it'll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we'll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer's hands.\\n8\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\n~$2,300,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\nHorsepower\\n739 hp\\nTorque\\n737 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n209 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n3.3 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 16\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley's incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it's the convertible version of the\\nBatur\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it's every bit as\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\n.\\nRelated\\nHow Bentley's Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\nPosts\\n1\\nBy\\nRyan De Villiers\\nAug 2, 2024\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they'll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they'll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\n7\\nAston Martin Valiant\\n$2,500,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n734 hp\\nTorque\\n555 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 38\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\nValiant\\n, which is an evolution of the\\nValour\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand's incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it's mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn't announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\n6\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\n$2,650,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\nHorsepower\\n1,817 hp\\nTorque\\n1,193 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 12\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we're not surprised it's unveiled a\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it's an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\nRelated\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\nPosts\\nBy\\nKyle Francis\\nDec 6, 2024\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it's also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we're stuck dreaming.\\n5\\nF80\\n$3,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,184 hp\\nTorque\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-62 mph\\n2.15 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 799\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there's one company capable of doing it, it's Ferrari.\\nRelated\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80's V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\nPosts\\nBy\\nJacob Oliva\\nOct 22, 2024\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\n12Cilindri\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there's no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we're hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\n4\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\n$3,300,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n851 hp\\nTorque\\n811 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 130\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it's a company in the business of creating art as much as it's in the business of creating supercars, but the\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you'll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\nUtopia\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\n3\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\"Bruce Wayne\\\"\\n$4,200,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\nQuad Electric Motors\\nHorsepower\\n1,877 hp\\nTorque\\n1,726 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n222 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n1.79 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 4\\nThis is one of\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\n, and it's all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman's fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it's teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They're based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\nBattista\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the 'Gotham' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\"Bruce Wayne\\\".

The watch face took two years alone to develop and five months to fit in place. Along with the innumerable other pieces of the car that were perfected and hand-placed, the unbelievable price tag is a little more understandable.
