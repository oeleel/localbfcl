From the ancient roots of Da Hong Pao to the novelty of Panda Dung Tea, these brews are priced not just for their flavour but for their rarity, heritage, and elaborate production methods. Discover how a simple cup of tea can transform into a liquid treasure, with some costing more than designer jewellery or fine wine in this list of the world\\u2019s most expensive teas.\\nAdd as a preferred source on Google\\nJoin us\\nList of the Top Most Expensive Tea in the World\\nTea is much more than just a hot beverage; it's a celebration of custom, artistry, and occasionally incredible luxury. Some teas have earned not only recognition for their fragrance but also for the legends and customs surrounding them, from panda-fertilised estates to historic mountain gardens. Furthermore, a single cup of rare brew can cost more than a rare cup of coffee or a fashionable purse.\\nLet\\u2019s take a flavourful detour through the\\nworld\\u2019s 10 most expensive teas\\n, each one offering a fascinating peek into centuries-old rituals, nature\\u2019s rarity, and human artistry.\\nList of the Top 5 Most Expensive Tea in the World\\nMost Expensive Tea in the World\\nRank\\nTea Name\\nEstimated Price\\nOrigin\\n1\\nDa Hong Pao (Big Red Robe)\\n$1.2 Million/kg\\nWuyi Mountains, China\\n2\\nPanda Dung Tea\\n$70,000/kg\\nSichuan, China\\n3\\nPG Tips Diamond Tea Bag\\n$15,000 per bag\\nUnited Kingdom\\n4\\nVintage Narcissus Oolong\\n$7,165 per kg\\nWuyi Mountains, China\\n5\\nTieguanyin\\n$3,307 per kg\\nFujian, China\\nHere is a brief overview of the most expensive tea in the world\\n1. Da Hong Pao (Big Red Robe)\\nSource: westernimmortaltea\\nDa Hong Pao is the world\\u2019s most expensive tea. It is harvested from ancient mother trees over 350 years old since the Ming Dynasty. This tea is cultivated in a unique terroir, where rocky soil and a misty climate contribute to its unique taste, which is known as \\u201cyan-yun\\u201d\\n2. Panda Dung Tea\\nSource: pinterest\\nPanda dung tea is the second most expensive tea in the world. This tea turns unconventional and luxurious due to its uniqueness in the stem. For the cultivation of this tea, panda dung is used as a fertiliser. The nutrients which this tea gets are from panda dung only, as pandas eat only bamboo, so all their nutrients come out in their dung form. Therefore, their dung is used as fertiliser in cultivating the panda dung tea.\\n3. PG Tips Diamond Tea Bag\\nSource: luxuo\\nPG Tips Diamond Tea Bag comes as a luxury product for drinking tea. This teabag was created to commemorate the 75th anniversary of British tea brand PG Tips. This teabag has a unique feature, as it is handcrafted with 2.56-carat diamonds. It makes it not just a teabag, but it is like an antique jewellery item. Its connecting chain is made with gold, and it contains silver Tips Imperial leaves, which are cultivated in India at Makaibari Tea Estate. This tea was created for charity to raise money for the Royal Manchester Children\\u2019s Hospital.\\n4. Vintage Narcissus Oolong\\nSource: storiesabouttea\\nVintage Narcissus, which is also known as \\u201cShui Xian\\u201d, is a highly esteemed oolong tea which is found in the Wuyi Mountains in China. This tea got its name from the Greek mythological character Narcissus, who is renowned for his beauty. This tea was kept for a long time before serving, and the most fragrance and enhancement in taste come from the time spent only in this tea.\\n5. Tieguanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)\\nSource: grandteaimports\\nTieguanyin tea is one of the esteemed teas which has been cultivated in the Fujian province, China, since the 19th century. It is one of the most refined oolong teas, and its spring pluck is the most valued.\\u00a0 The process involved in making Tieguanyin tea is the most important step, as it includes withering, rolling, oxidising and roasting. Tieguanyin tea is named after one of the Buddhist deities, the Iron Goddess of Mercy.\\nWhy Do These Teas Cost a Fortune?\\nIt\\u2019s not just about the taste. The eye-watering prices are justified by a mix of factors:\\n1. Limited Supply:\\nMany of these teas are picked only once a year, in specific regions, often from ancient or rare plants.\\n2. Traditional Processing:\\nLeaves are often\\nhand-rolled\\n,\\nsun-dried\\n, or\\nroasted\\nusing centuries-old methods \\u2014 a labour-intensive process that adds to their value.\\n3. Cultural Heritage:\\nSome of these brews date back to\\nimperial dynasties\\n, with legends of emperors sipping them in remote mountain temples.\\n4. Exquisite Presentation:\\nThink diamond-encrusted teabags, gold-painted leaves, or ceremonial packaging that\\u2019s as rare as the tea itself.\\nConclusion\\nThe world\\u2019s priciest teas aren\\u2019t just drinks; they are\\nliquid heirlooms\\n, packed with stories, legacy, and tradition. But remember, the real joy of tea isn\\u2019t in its price \\u2014 it\\u2019s in the peace, the warmth, and the comfort it brings with every cup.\\nPrabhat Mishra\\nContent Writer\\nPrabhat Mishra is an accomplished content creator with over 2 years of expertise in education, national and international news, and current affairs.

Daphne Bridgerton makes her debut into society along with the three Featherington sisters, including Penelope; Daphne is given high praise by Queen Charlotte. Daphne's older brother, Anthony, Viscount Bridgerton, drives away many potential suitors except the detestable Lord Berbrooke, and her popularity threatens to be eclipsed by Marina Thompson, Penelope's cousin. Meanwhile, Simon Basset, the new Duke of Hastings and an old friend of Anthony's, returns to London upon his father's death. His old acquaintance Lady Danbury coaxes him into joining the season, where he encounters both Anthony and Daphne. After breaking up with his mistress, Siena Rosso, Anthony promises a horrified Daphne to Berbrooke. Lady Featherington confronts Marina, having deduced that she is pregnant. Later on, after following her from an event, Berbrooke accosts Daphne, and she punches him in self-defense. Having arrived moments before, Simon suggests to her that they pretend to court to enhance her prospects and free him from any of his own. Daphne agrees, and the new couple instantly draws attention from the ton.\\n2\\n2\\n\\\"Shock and Delight\\\"\\nTom Verica\\nJanet Lin\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nFlashbacks reveal Simon's tragic childhood. After his mother died in childbirth, Simon's cruel father rejected him upon discovering his stammer. Lady Danbury came to his aid, supervising his education and helping him to overcome his speech issues. As revenge for his father's negligence, Simon vows to him at his deathbed that he will never sire an heir. Penelope shares her confusion with Eloise Bridgerton as to how a child is conceived; Marina is confined to her room by Lady Featherington but shares with Penelope that her pregnancy came from a man named Sir George Crane, a soldier. Simon and Daphne's ruse works perfectly, but Anthony is upset by Simon's supposed pursuit of his sister. When Simon tells Anthony what Lord Berbrooke tried to do to Daphne, Anthony breaks his agreement with Lord Berbrooke. However, Berbrooke acquires a special marriage license and threatens to ruin Daphne's name. Lady Bridgerton intervenes and is able to influence Lady Whistledown to reveal a scandal that forces Berbrooke to leave London.\\n3\\n3\\n\\\"Art of the Swoon\\\"\\nTom Verica\\nLeila Cohan-Miccio\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nDaphne turns down multiple proposals as she grows closer to Simon. Lady Featherington tries to find a match for Marina, but she insists on waiting for word from George. Determined to prove that she is still the true ruler of London society, the Queen schemes to match Daphne with her nephew, Prince Friedrich of Prussia. Lady Danbury tells Simon that he needs to propose to Daphne or step aside, and Simon reluctantly calls off the fake courtship. Benedict Bridgerton suspects Eloise of being Lady Whistledown, but instead learns they are both dissatisfied with their prospects. Anthony tries to reconcile with Siena, but she turns him down. Marina receives a letter from George stating his refusal to take responsibility for her child, but the letter was forged by Lady Featherington. Lady Bridgerton pushes Anthony to think about a match for himself. Simon decides to leave London early as a heartbroken Daphne embraces Prince Friedrich's attentions.\\n4\\n4\\n\\\"An Affair of Honor\\\"\\nSheree Folkson\\nAbby McDonald\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nPrince Friedrich gifts Daphne a necklace to show his interest. Marina is presented to older suitors in want of heirs to marry her off quickly. Eloise tries to uncover Lady Whistledown's identity. Marina is saved from an elderly suitor by Colin Bridgerton, one of her many early admirers. Anthony tells Daphne that Friedrich asked for his consent to propose. During a ball, an undecided Daphne flees to the garden, where Simon approaches her to say goodbye and apologize. Upset, Daphne runs into a hedge maze; Simon follows, and the two share a passionate kiss, but are discovered by Anthony. Anthony furiously demands that they marry; when Simon refuses, he challenges him to a duel at dawn. Penelope is crushed by Colin's interest in Marina, having secretly loved him for years. Anthony plans to use the duel to free himself from society and be with Siena. Lady Featherington discovers her husband's gambling debts, and deduces that their daughters will be deprived of dowries and they will be forced to continue accommodating Marina. Daphne realizes that Cressida Cowper, her rival for Prince Friedrich's affections, witnessed what happened in the garden and races to stop the duel. Simon claims that he cannot marry her because he cannot provide her with children. Weighing her options, Daphne firmly declares they will marry anyway.\\n5\\n5\\n\\\"The Duke and I\\\"\\nSheree Folkson\\nJoy C Mitchell\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nDaphne and Simon petition for a special marriage license, but are refused due to the Queen's ire at Daphne rejecting her nephew. As money issues plague the Featherington home, Penelope grows more jealous of Colin's interest in Marina and wary of Marina's motives. Benedict is invited to a party by the artist Sir Henry Granville. Lady Featherington orders Marina to stop pursuing Colin, but Marina assures her she has a plan. Simon and Daphne appeal to the Queen for an early wedding; with King George growing more incapacitated, the Queen is moved by Simon's impassioned plea. Simon and Daphne are married. Following an unsuccessful attempt to seduce him, Marina receives a proposal from Colin at the wedding reception, but is dismayed to learn he wishes for a long engagement. The Queen takes interest in Eloise's investigation into Lady Whistledown's identity. Lady Bridgerton's attempts to explain a wedding night leave Daphne with more questions than answers. On their way to Simon's family home, he and Daphne spend the night at an inn. Daphne finally confronts Simon over his indifference towards her, spurring him to confess that his declaration of love was genuine, and Daphne confesses she feels the same; despite Daphne's lack of awareness, the pair consummate their marriage.\\n6\\n6\\n\\\"Swish\\\"\\nJulie Anne Robinson\\nSarah Dollard\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nSimon and Daphne arrive at Clyvedon and enjoy their honeymoon. Daphne has difficulty building a relationship with Clyvedon's housekeeper Mrs. Colson and the local villagers. Colin announces his engagement to Marina, to the dismay of his family and Penelope. Penelope tells Colin that Marina is in love with another man, but he is unbothered and suggests to Marina that they should marry sooner by traveling to Scotland. Daphne learns from Mrs. Colson about Simon's upbringing. Penelope deduces that George's letter was faked, but Marina chooses to marry Colin anyway. Marina realizes Penelope loves him, and bluntly condemns Penelope's feelings, reducing Penelope to tears. With the help of her lady's maid, Daphne figures out that Simon could have children if he chose to, but is deliberately withdrawing early to avoid impregnating her. Later, while having sex with Simon, she holds him down so he cannot withdraw, and confronts him afterward, accusing him of lying to her about being infertile. Just as Colin and Marina prepare to elope, Lady Whistledown publishes Marina's pregnancy, exposing her.\\n7\\n7\\n\\\"Oceans Apart\\\"\\nAlrick Riley\\nJay Ross & Abby McDonald\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nAmid their marital dispute, Daphne decides to return to London to assist in undoing the scandal surrounding Colin. Simon willingly joins her, but now wishes to live separately from Daphne if she is not with child. Eloise continues to investigate Lady Whistledown, now desiring to restore the Featherington name. Colin is devastated to learn Marina was using him to secure a future for her baby; Daphne, feeling sympathetic, offers to help Marina find George. The Queen grows irritable at Eloise's failure to uncover Lady Whistledown and later throws the Featheringtons out of her luncheon. Daphne enlists the help of a general's wife to locate Sir George. Lord Featherington approaches boxer Will Mondrich to convince him to throw his next fight; Will considers it, as the money Lord Featherington has offered could ensure his family's security. Daphne learns Simon swore to his father he would not have children, but still does not understand why. Eloise concludes that modiste Genevieve Delacroix is the most likely candidate for Lady Whistledown's true identity. Marina attempts to induce a miscarriage, and Penelope finds her unconscious. At the opera, Daphne learns she is not pregnant; she cries in her mother's arms, with Simon in earshot.\\n8\\n8\\n\\\"After the Rain\\\"\\nAlrick Riley\\nChris Van Dusen\\nDecember\\u00a025,\\u00a02020\\n(\\n2020-12-25\\n)\\nGeorge's brother Sir Philip Crane arrives to tell Marina that George died in battle. Philip offers to marry Marina himself, but she turns him down believing she has ended her pregnancy. Eloise confronts Genevieve and, believing her to be Lady Whistledown, tries to covertly convince her to restore the Featheringtons' honor. Daphne learns of Simon's childhood from Lady Danbury. Simon reconsiders what he wants after spending time with Daphne's younger siblings. Siena rejects Anthony's attempts to bring her into the ton, saying that he should move on. Lord Featherington makes a bet against Will with ill-reputed bookmakers; Will throws the fight and receives half of Lord Featherington's winnings, while the latter is subsequently murdered by the bookmakers. Marina accepts Philip's proposal after discovering that she is still pregnant, and departs London with him. Penelope considers confessing her love to Colin, but before she can, he reveals that he is leaving the country to travel.

What we're really doing with the show is marrying history and fantasy in what I think is a very exciting way. One approach that we took to that is our approach to race.\\\"\\n[\\n249\\n]\\nThough Bridgerton takes place during the Regency era, Van Dusen notes that it ultimately is \\\"not a history lesson.\\\"\\n[\\n250\\n]\\nThe Bridgerton family, Lady Whistledown, and most of the other characters in the show are fictional.\\n[\\n251\\n]\\n[\\n252\\n]\\n[\\n249\\n]\\nThe theory that\\nQueen Charlotte\\nmay have had African ancestry has been called an unhistorical assertion by most scholars.\\n[\\n253\\n]\\n[\\n254\\n]\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nIn an interview with\\nInsider\\nmagazine, American historian Marlene Koenig said the show's representation of\\nRegency-era London\\nwas more diverse than it was in reality, adding that \\\"diversity as we know what the word means did not exist\\\" in\\nBritain\\nduring that period.\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nSome classical music pieces used in the first season were composed later than 1813, the year of the first season. Examples include\\nDmitri Shostakovich\\n's\\nSuite for Variety Orchestra\\n, which was written sometime after 1956, and \\\"\\nBelle nuit, \\u00f4 nuit d'amour\\n\\\" from\\nJacques Offenbach\\n's 1881 opera\\nThe Tales of Hoffmann\\n.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nHistorians have pointed out inaccuracies in clothing, such as the show using\\ncorsets\\nto represent the oppression placed on women in society instead of supportive undergarments they were considered as in the\\nRegency era\\n.\\n[\\n256\\n]\\nIn a scene from season 1, Daphne is seen with bruises on her back from the corset; however, at the time it was common to wear a chemise under it to prevent this.\\n[\\n257\\n]\\nFabrics and patterns appearing in the show are too modern compared to the ones used in the historical period in which the events are supposed to take place.\\n[\\n258\\n]\\nOther historical inaccuracies include the lack of bonnets present within the show and the contemporary styles of the fabrics and colors. However, a majority of the show's historical inaccuracies regarding clothing are intentional. The show does not reflect an accurate portrayal of the Regency era but rather a world that \\\"borders on historical fantasy.\\\"\\n[\\n259\\n]\\nThe show depicts a dramatization of the Regency era, where the show is \\\"rooted in Regency times but the volume is turned up.\\\"\\n[\\n259\\n]\\nThemes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nGender\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nA recurring topic throughout the show is gender, especially the role of women in British high society. Chris Van Dusen aimed for the show to have a \\\"running, modern commentary about how, over the last 200 years, everything has changed and nothing has changed, for both women and men.\\\"\\n[\\n260\\n]\\nWith the focus on each year's social season, Daphne, Kate, Penelope and the other women struggle against the societal expectations held for them. Daphne Bridgerton, the Queen's Diamond of her season, fights to maintain her high reputation in society and avoid ruin while still marrying for love. Kate Sharma, considered \\\"too old\\\" for marrying, attempts to regain her family's place in high society as she tries to set her sister, Edwina, up to marry well. Eloise Bridgerton, uninterested in marrying and wanting to pursue a more meaningful life, finds herself more politically involved.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nThe men, on the other hand, often face lower stakes to their reputations. After overhearing Anthony say that he desires a more agreeable wife, Kate confronts him on his viewpoints toward women and argues that Anthony's high standards for women do not match the standards he has for himself.\\n[\\n261\\n]\\nRace\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nA notable, modernized twist on the show is the diverse cast of characters. Straying from the source novels, Van Dusen \\\"used Queen Charlotte as a centerpiece to weave racial equality in the show.\\\"\\n[\\n260\\n]\\nWith Queen Charlotte cast as a Black woman, Van Dusen explains, \\\"Could she have used her power to elevate other people of color in society? Could she have given them titles and lands and dukedoms?\\\"\\n[\\n262\\n]\\nWhen Simon Basset rejects the idea of pursuing Daphne Bridgerton, Lady Danbury explains that love conquers all, using Queen Charlotte and King George as an example of how their marriage had changed society.\\n[\\n263\\n]\\nHowever, Simon also counters that, even though Queen Charlotte is currently in power, \\\"Black progress is fragile and dependent on the whims of whichever white king is in charge.\\\"\\n[\\n262\\n]\\nLiterature\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBridgerton\\nalso explores \\\"power of the written word,\\\" with authors such as Lady Whistledown having immense influence over the social season with her Society Papers. Similar to how media can strongly sway public opinion, Van Dusen makes the statement that \\\"social media is kind of like a modern-day corset.\\\"\\n[\\n260\\n]\\nThroughout the show, Lady Whistledown releases Society Papers that comment on notable figures during the social season, whether it be praising them or airing out their secrets. The pamphlets' influence is enough to sway even Queen Charlotte herself, who seeks to find the author of the Society Papers in order to shut them down.\\n[\\n264\\n]\\nPrequel miniseries\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\\nIn May 2021, Netflix ordered a limited prequel series from\\nShondaland\\nto focus on young Queen Charlotte, a character who does not appear in the\\nBridgerton\\nnovels.

As a consequence the\\nAzerbaijan Grand Prix\\nmoved from April to September.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nThe\\nRussian Grand Prix\\nwas under contract to feature on the 2024 calendar.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nHowever, the contract was terminated in\\n2022\\nin response to the\\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\\n.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nRegulation changes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTechnical regulations\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn response to extreme weather conditions resulting in cockpit overheating during the\\n2023 Qatar Grand Prix\\n, teams were now allowed to install a \\\"scoop\\\" to the car that is intended to cool down the driver and cockpit area.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nTeams were not allowed to start wind tunnel or\\ncomputational fluid dynamics\\nwork for the 2026 season, which will see major technical regulations rule changes, until 1 January 2025. However, teams were still allowed to do other preliminary research and development work not covered by these restrictions.\\n[\\n62\\n]\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nTyres\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe \\\"alternative tyre allocation\\\" trialled at the\\n2023 Hungarian\\nand\\nItalian\\nGrands Prix, where drivers were given 11 sets of tyres in an attempt to cut costs in the sport, was discontinued. Therefore, teams reverted to having 13 sets of tyres available per driver during every non-sprint race weekend with the allocation being 12 sets for a sprint weekend.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nThe C0 tyre compound (the hardest compound in\\nPirelli\\n's dry tyre range), which was introduced but not used during the\\n2023\\nseason, was dropped from the tyre line-up.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nThis compound was previously known as the C1, but was renamed at the start of the 2023 season following the introduction of a new C1 compound that slotted between the old C1 and current C2 compounds in terms of hardness.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nA proposed trial for a ban on tyre blankets for this season and a full ban in 2025 was abandoned.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nSporting regulations\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAppeals process\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe decision appeal process was amended for the 2024 season. The deadline to submit a right of review request was reduced from fourteen to four days after an event. In an attempt to stop potentially frivolous appeal attempts, the FIA also introduced a fee for the process.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nSprint weekend structure\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe structure of the sprint weekends was changed again for 2024, with the goal of rationalising sprint events and separating them from the rest of the Grand Prix weekend.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nA sprint weekend began with a single practice session, followed by the sprint qualifying session, which set the starting grid order for the sprint race. The sprint was then the first session to take place on Saturday, followed by qualifying for the main race. The Grand Prix itself remained on Sunday.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nThe FIA sporting regulations for the championship now referred to the qualifying for the sprint as \\\"sprint qualifying\\\", as opposed to \\\"sprint shootout\\\". The term \\\"sprint qualifying\\\" was previously used in the inaugural season of the sprint format in\\n2021\\nto refer to the sprint itself.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nAdditionally, sprint weekends now had two separate\\nparc ferm\\u00e9\\nperiods as opposed to one. The first lasted from the beginning of sprint qualifying to the end of the sprint, and the second lasted from the beginning of qualifying for the Grand Prix until the start of the Grand Prix itself.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nDRS usage\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe rules for\\nDRS\\nusage in Grands Prix were adjusted slightly. Drivers were now allowed to use DRS one lap after a race start, safety car restart, or red flag restart, one lap earlier than in previous seasons. This modification, tested during sprint events in 2023, was implemented to encourage earlier overtaking opportunities and increase competitiveness in the opening stages of a race.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nPower unit allocation\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe FIA increased the number of internal combustion engine (ICE) components and associated power unit elements allowed per driver from three to four per season. This change was made to accommodate the record-length calendar and reduce the frequency of grid penalties caused by engine wear and failure.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nMaximum lap time\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nPrior to Thursday's two practice sessions at the season-opening\\nBahrain Grand Prix\\n, updated rules were introduced to discourage drivers from driving too slowly on in-laps and reconnaissance laps during qualifying. Drivers were initially required to not exceed a maximum time taken to drive through each marshalling sector. This was a change from 2023, when the FIA introduced a maximum time across an entire lap.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nHowever, prior to Friday's third practice session and qualifying, the rules were reverted to the 2023 full-lap method, though the rule now applied on both in-laps and out-laps.\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nPenalties\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe standard sanction for a driver overtaking another driver off the track and gaining a lasting advantage was upgraded from a five-second time penalty to a ten-second time penalty, although five-second penalties could still be awarded. The change was made as the five-second penalty was considered insufficient, with drivers regularly gaining more than five seconds through illegally overtaking slower cars off track.\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nFrom the\\nMiami Grand Prix\\nonwards the FIA altered the regulations for judging a potential\\njump start\\n. Under the previous regulations, stewards were unable to penalise a driver for a jump start if it had not been picked up by an FIA\\ntransponder\\n. This rule led to\\nLando Norris\\nof\\nMcLaren\\nappearing to avoid a penalty despite visibly moving early at the start of the\\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix\\n. The update to regulations allowed stewards to penalise a driver if they were moving before the start, even if the transponder did not register the infringement. The regulation also clarified jump starts would be judged \\\"after the four-second light is illuminated and before the start signal is given by extinguishing all red lights.\\\"\\n[\\n79\\n]\\nFrom the\\nDutch Grand Prix\\n, penalties accrued during the sprint race which could not be served, due to retirement, could be transferred into grid penalties for their next race. This had already been the case for penalties accrued in Grands Prix.\\n[\\n80\\n]\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nTesting\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDuring the summer break, the regulations were updated to allow teams to create\\nmule cars\\nbased on existing cars from the\\n2020\\n\\u2013\\n2023\\nperiod to enable teams to better prepare for the changes to the technical regulations due for the\\n2026\\nseason. Teams using the mule cars would only be allowed to use drivers with 500 kilometres (310\\u00a0mi) of experience of driving a current Formula One car at consistent racing speeds.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nRed flag procedure\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDuring the summer break, the regulations for red flag procedures were clarified: during a red flag period, cars could be instructed to line-up on the starting grid, instead of in the pit lane, where the pit lane needed to be closed for safety reasons. The regulations were additionally altered to state that a driver who stops outside of the pit lane during qualifying and receives physical assistance will no longer be able to participate in qualifying.\\n[\\n80\\n]\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nSeason summary\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nPre-season\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nA single pre-season test was held at the\\nBahrain International Circuit\\nin\\nSakhir\\non 21\\u201323 February.\\n[\\n83\\n]\\n[\\n84\\n]\\nCarlos Sainz Jr.\\nof\\nFerrari\\nset the fastest time in the three-day test,\\nHaas\\ncompleted the most laps.\\n[\\n85\\n]\\nOpening rounds\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nRed Bull Racing\\ndominated the opening races of the season with 1\\u20132 victories at the\\nBahrain\\n,\\nSaudi Arabian\\nand\\nJapanese\\nGrands Prix, and a 1\\u20133 at the\\nChinese Grand Prix\\n.\\nThe season began with a\\nRed Bull\\n1\\u20132 at the\\nBahrain Grand Prix\\n.\\nMax Verstappen\\ntook pole position ahead of\\nCharles Leclerc\\nand\\nGeorge Russell\\n.

In the Constructors' Standings, defending champions Red Bull led\\nFerrari\\nby 17 points,\\nMercedes\\nwere an additional 11 points back in third and eventual constructors champions McLaren were 4th, 32 points behind Red Bull.\\n[\\n91\\n]\\nRed Bull Racing continued to show their pace at the\\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix\\nwith Verstappen taking pole,\\n[\\n92\\n]\\nand winning the race in \\\"dominant\\\" fashion, securing his 100th podium.\\n[\\n93\\n]\\n[\\n94\\n]\\nVerstappen led the opening laps of the race. A\\nsafety car\\nperiod, following a crash involving\\nLance Stroll\\n, was called on lap 7. Verstappen, along with the top 5, chose to make a pitstop during this phase, with Norris inheriting the lead. Verstappen overtook Norris for the lead on lap 12, and held it for the rest of the race. P\\u00e9rez finished second, having started in third, making his past Leclerc for second in the early stages, Leclerc maintained third to the race's conclusion.\\nOscar Piastri\\nfinished fourth, having struggled to overtake\\nLewis Hamilton\\nfor a large portion of the race. During the weekend, Sainz was affected with\\nappendicitis\\n, which resulted in his withdrawal from the event on Friday morning to have surgery. In his place,\\nFerrari\\njunior driver\\nOliver Bearman\\n, stood in for Sainz.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nBearman qualified eleventh and went on to finish seventh, and was widely praised for his performance, having missed the weekend's opening two practice sessions.\\n[\\n96\\n]\\nFollowing the races' conclusion, Verstappen extended his championship lead to 15 points over P\\u00e9rez, Leclerc moved into third, 12 points further behind. Norris was seventh, 39 points behind Verstappen. Red Bull extended their lead to 38 points over Ferrari, McLaren moved into third, an additional 21 points behind.\\n[\\n97\\n]\\nAlex Albon crashed his car heavily during the first practice session for the Australian Grand Prix, writing off the chassis. With no spare chassis available, Williams made the decision for Albon to take over Logan Sargeant's car, with Sargeant withdrawing from the weekend. Team principal James Vowles justified this decision by arguing Albon had a better chance to score points, and praised Sargeant for his sportsmanship.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\nVerstappen took pole position, with Sainz second and P\\u00e9rez qualifying third,\\n[\\n99\\n]\\nP\\u00e9rez was demoted three places for impeding, promoting Norris to third on the starting grid.\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nVerstappen retained the lead at the race start, before suffering from brake issues, Sainz made his way past Verstappen into the lead on lap 2, with Verstappen retiring the car shortly afterwards. This retirement meant Verstappen would fail to take a record equalling 10th consecutive victory. Sainz was able to build a lead over his rivals and secured the win largely unchalleged. His teammate\\nCharles Leclerc\\nsuccessfully\\nundercut\\nNorris to take second. Norris completed the podium and succeeded\\nNick Heidfeld\\nfor the most podiums without a victory in Formula One. Piastri finished fourth, having been instructed to let Norris, with P\\u00e9rez fifth. Alonso and Russell were running sixth and seventh in the final stages, with Russell attacking Alonso, before Russell crashed in the closing laps, Alonso was deemed to have driven in a \\\"potentially dangerous way in the build up to the incident earning him a post race penalty.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nFollowing the race Verstappen and Red Bull maintained their championship leads with 51 and 97 points respectively. In the drivers' championship Leclerc moved to second, on 47 points with P\\u00e9rez third on 46, Norris was 6th on 27. In the constructors', Ferrari closed the gap to 4 points, with McLaren 42 points behind Red Bull.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nVerstappen took pole position at the\\nJapanese Grand Prix\\n, 0.066 seconds ahead of P\\u00e9rez, who had his first front-row start since the\\n2023 Miami Grand Prix\\n, with Norris third and Sainz fourth.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nThe top five maintained their positions at the race start, before the race was red-flagged due to a heavy crash that involved\\nDaniel Ricciardo\\nand\\nAlexander Albon\\nat turn three, which necessitated repairs to the tyre barriers. The top runners again maintained position at the restart, with Verstappen quickly managing to extend a one-second lead, putting him outside DRS range. Norris was the first on the front runners to pit on lap 12, with the rest of the top four following suit over the next few laps, with Norris\\nundercutting\\nP\\u00e9rez and Leclerc taking the lead, having yet to make a stop, over the following laps, Verstappen retook the race lead, and P\\u00e9rez regained second from both Norris and Leclerc before the latter made his pitstop, undercutting Norris into third. In the closing stages Sainz closed in on and overtook Norris for fourth, and then overtook teammate Leclerc for third courtesy of team orders, Sainz was the faster car and\\nFerrari\\nfelt that a battle for position would risk Norris catching and overtaking at least one of the pair. The race therefore ended with Verstappen winning ahead of P\\u00e9rez, Sainz and Leclerc with Norris in fifth.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nRicciardo's teammate Tsunoda scored a point, making him the first\\nJapanese driver\\nto score points at their home race since\\nKamui Kobayashi\\n's podium in the\\n2012 edition of the race\\n.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\nFollowing the race, Verstappen extended his Championship lead to 13 points, with P\\u00e9rez moving into second, Leclerc a further four points back on 59. Sainz remained in fourth with Norris moving up to fifth. In the constructors' Championship, Red Bull moved to 141 points, 21 ahead of Ferrari and 72 ahead of McLaren.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe\\nChinese Grand Prix\\nsaw the first sprint of the season. Sprint qualifying was held in wet conditions and ended with Norris taking pole ahead of Hamilton and Fernando Alonso.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nChampionship leader Verstappen struggled in the first\\nsprint\\nqualifying of the season, ending up fourth.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nVerstappen went on to win the sprint race, he gained one position at the first turn, after polesitter Norris ran wide and dropped to seventh after the first lap. Verstappen overtook Alonso for second on lap 7, and Hamilton for the lead on lap 9 where he remained for the rest of the race. Behind Verstappen, Hamilton finished second. In the closing laps, a fight for third place emerged between Alonso, P\\u00e9rez, Leclerc, Sainz and Norris. Sainz attempted an overtake on Alonso, opening a gap for P\\u00e9rez to take third and Leclerc fourth. Alonso dropped back with a puncture, allowing Sainz to take fifth ahead of Norris.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nVerstappen took Red Bull's 100th pole position for the Grand Prix, ahead of P\\u00e9rez and Alonso.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nVerstappen managed to maintain his lead into the opening turn, while Alonso managed to overtake P\\u00e9rez for second around the outside of turn 1. Norris and Piastri retained fourth and fifth. The Ferrari pair of Leclerc and Sainz dropped to seventh and eighth. The opening laps saw Alonso drop down to fourth behind P\\u00e9rez and Norris, and Leclerc move up to fifth, gaining positions from H\\u00fclkenberg, Russell and Piastri before the pit stop phase opened. Alonso, Verstappen, P\\u00e9rez, Piastri and Sainz all made pit stops before a\\nsafety car\\nwas deployed. Under this safety car, Norris and Leclerc made their only pitstops of the race, with Verstappen, P\\u00e9rez and Piastri taking second pit stops for fresher tyres. This saw Verstappen leading from Norris, Leclerc, P\\u00e9rez and Sainz, Russell, Leclerc and Piastri. The second half of the race saw a battle develop between Leclerc and P\\u00e9rez for the final podium position, with P\\u00e9rez moving into third on lap 39. Verstappen was able to win the race, ahead of Norris, P\\u00e9rez, Leclerc, Sainz, Russell, Alonso and Piastri.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nAt the races conclusion, Verstappen moved to 110 points, 25 clear of P\\u00e9rez in second, and 34 clear of Leclerc in third. Sainz and Leclerc retained fourth and fifth on 69 and 58 points. In the Constructors' standings, Red Bull moved 44 points clear of second placed Ferrari, with McLaren a further 55 points back.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nThe\\nMiami Grand Prix\\nsaw a second consecutive sprint weekend. In sprint qualifying, Verstappen took pole from Leclerc and P\\u00e9rez, with Sainz fifth behind Ricciardo.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\nThe Mclaren pair were fastest across practice and the opening sprint qualifying sessions but were unable to replicate this in the final part of sprint qualifying and ended up sixth and ninth.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nAt the start of the sprint, Verstappen immediately covered the inside of the opening turn to maintain first place. P\\u00e9rez attempted a move for second around the outside of the corner but ran wide, yielding third to\\nDaniel Ricciardo\\n. Norris was tipped into a spin at the first corner, and was then hit by Stroll, causing Norris' retirement with terminal damage. After a brief safety car period, the lead drivers initially maintained position. Ricciardo was overtaken for third on lap 5. The race ended with Verstappen winning from Leclerc and P\\u00e9rez, with Ricciardo able to narrowly hold on to fourth from Sainz and Piastri.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nVerstappen took pole for the Grand Prix ahead of Leclerc, Sainz, P\\u00e9rez  and the McLaren duo of Norris and Piastri.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nVerstappen was able to maintain his lead through the first corner. Behind, P\\u00e9rez locked his front tyres causing Sainz and Leclerc to take avoiding action. Leclerc was able to maintain second, with Piastri making his way up to third ahead of Sainz, P\\u00e9rez and Norris. A couple of laps into the Grands Prix, Piastri was able to overtake Leclerc for second. P\\u00e9rez was the first of leading cars to pit, and was soon followed by Leclerc, Verstappen, Piastri and Sainz before the safety car was deployed following a collision between Magnussen and Sargeant. Norris took advantage of this to make a pitstop and rejoined the track in first, ahead of Verstappen, Leclerc, Piastri, Sainz and P\\u00e9rez. At the safety car restart, Verstappen briefly challeneged Norris for lead, before Norris was able to pull away. Sainz managed to make his way past Piastri. Piastri attempted to retake the position, but collided with Sainz, forcing Piastri to pit for repairs and dropping him out of the points. Norris took his maiden Formula One victory, having previously held the record of the most podiums without a victory, and giving McLaren their first victory since the\\n2021 Italian Grand Prix\\n. Verstappen was second from Leclerc, P\\u00e9rez, Sainz, with Hamilton achieving his best result of the season to that point with sixth. Ocon scored Alpine's first point of the season with tenth place.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nFollowing the event, Verstappen increased his points tally to 136, 33 ahead of second placed P\\u00e9rez, with Leclerc in third an additional five points back and Sainz and Norris both on 83 points. In the Constructors Championship, Red Bull extended their lead over second placed Ferrari to 52, and their lead over third place McLaren to 115.\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nMid-season rounds\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAt the\\nEmilia Romagna Grand Prix\\n, Verstappen took an \\\"unexpected\\\" pole by 0.074 seconds, equalling\\nAyrton Senna\\n's record of eight consecutive pole positions.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nPiastri was second, ahead of Norris and the Ferrari pair of Leclerc and Sainz, P\\u00e9rez qualified 11th.\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nPiastri was demoted to fifth on the starting grid for impeding another driver during qualifying.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nThe top six drivers held positions on the opening lap, with P\\u00e9rez making up ground and overtaking\\nDaniel Ricciardo\\nfor tenth. The leading cars made their pit stops around the twenty lap mark with McLaren duo pitting first and then Verstappen, and the Ferrari pair. During the pit stop phase, Piastri was able to successfully\\nundercut\\nSainz for fourth place. As the race reached the 40 lap mark, Leclerc closed the gap to Norris, Leclerc being told he was the faster driver of the pair. By lap 50, Norris had stronger pace and was able to pull away from Leclerc and was also able to start closing the gap forward to Verstappen. Norris closed within a couple of seconds of Verstappen, but was unable to overtake before the races conclusion. Verstappen therefore won the race, ahead of Norris and Leclerc. Piastri claimed fourth ahead of Sainz, P\\u00e9rez recovered to 8th.\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nNorris stated that he could have overtaken Verstappen if the race were a couple of laps longer.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nFollowing the race, Verstappen moved to 161 points in the Drivers Championship. Lecelrc moved up to second on 113 with P\\u00e9rez dropping to third on 107. Norris moved into a clear fourth, 6 points behind P\\u00e9rez. In the Constructors' Standings, Red Bull's lead increased to 56 points over Ferrari, with McLaren a further 58 behind.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\nBy winning the\\nMonaco Grand Prix\\n,\\nCharles Leclerc\\nbecame only the second Mon\\u00e9gasque driver after\\nLouis Chiron\\nin\\n1931\\nto win at their home Grand Prix.\\nVerstappen's record equaling run of consecutive pole positions ended at the\\nMonaco Grand Prix\\n, as he qualified sixth. Pole position was instead taken by Mon\\u00e9gasque, Leclerc, ahead of Piastri, Sainz and Norris, P\\u00e9rez qualified 18th.\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nAt the start Leclerc held position,  Piastri and Sainz collided lightly at the first corner, resulting in Sainz receiving a puncture which dropped him down the feld. P\\u00e9rez, Magnussen and Hulkenberg were also involved in a collision which stranded the three cars on track, causing a\\nred flag\\n. The race was restarted based on the original starting order, meainng that Sainz would retain his third place start. For the second start, the drivers changed tyre compound, therefore fulfilling the rule to run two tyre compounds allowing them to complete the race without a pit stop. The race was run with the top five within a few seconds of each other, but no overtaking attempts. Leclerc took his first win since the\\n2022 Austrian Grand Prix\\nand the first at his home Grand Prix.\\nOscar Piastri\\ntook his first podium of the season in second, and Sainz finished third.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nFollowing the race, Verstappen's championship lead over Lerclerc was cut to 31 points. Norris and Sainz moved up to third and fourth, 56 and 61 points behind Verstappen, respectively. P\\u00e9rez dropped to fifth, one point behind Sainz. In the Constructors' Standings, Red Bull's lead was cut to 24 points over Ferrari, and 92 over McLaren.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nAfter Verstappen and Russell set identical lap times during qualifying for the\\nCanadian Grand Prix\\n, Russell secured pole position by virtue of setting the time first. Norris and Piastri were third and fourth, the Ferrari 11th and 12th with P\\u00e9rez 16th.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\nThe race began under wet conditions. Most of the field elected to start the race on the\\nintermediate wet tyre\\n, with the Haas duo of Magnussen and H\\u00fclkenberg starting on the full wet tyre. The leading drivers held position on the opening laps. A band of heavy rain played into Haas' favour with Magnussen and H\\u00fclkenberg able to make their through the field, with Magnussen running as high as fourth before the rain eased, and he lost his advantage. With the track starting to dry up, Norris was setting the fastest lap times and was able to make his way into the lead by 21. Verstappen also overtook Russell for second. Norris was able to pull away from Verstappen, with Russell dropping back towards Piastri. The safety car was deployed shortly afterwards, Verstappen and Russell made pit stops immediately, although Norris missed the pit lane and had to complete another lap. This allowed Verstappen and Russell to\\nundercut\\nNorris for first and second. After the safety car was withdrawn, Norris was once again the fastest car on track, but was unable to make a pass on Russell for second. Verstappen and Russell both made pitstops around lap 40 for dry weather tyres, with Norris electing to stay out until lap 47. When Norris made his stop, he was able to\\novercut\\nRussell and rejoined the track side by side with Verstappen. Verstappen was able to take first, and Norris dropped back on colder tyres, being overtaken by Russell for second, before Rusell made an error, allowing Norris back through. The closing laps saw Versappen and Norris pull clear and maintain first and second to the end. A fight ensued for the final podium position, which was claimed by Russell ahead of Hamilton and Piastri. Leclerc, Sainz and P\\u00e9rez all retired.\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nThe result saw Verstappen maintain the lead (on 194 points) ahead of Leclerc (138), Norris (131). In the Constructors, Red Bull moved to 301 points, ahead of Ferrari (252) and McLaren (212).\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nNorris took  his second career pole position at the\\nSpanish Grand Prix\\n, ahead of Verstappen, Hamilton, Russell, Leclerc and Sainz. P\\u00e9rez started the race in eleventh.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\nAt the start, Norris moved across the track to cut off Verstappen, with Verstappen ending up in the grass Russell was able to go around the outside of both of them at turn one and took the race lead and Verstappen moving up into second. Lap three saw Verstappen take the lead from Russell. The top three retained their positions until lap 16 when Russell made his put stop, with Verstappen pitting on lap 17 and Norris on lap 24, with the order staying the same amoungst the top three after the initial pit stop phase. Verstappen was able to extend his lead to eight seconds over Russell and Norris, who were fighting for second place, with Norris able to claim the position on lap 35; Russell and Norris's fight allowed Verstappen to extend his lead to nine seonds by the end of lap 36. Norris was able to start eating into Versappen's lead after taking second, with Norris closing the gap to four seconds by the time Verstappen made his second pit stop on lap 46; this saw Verstappen able to lap faster than Norris. Norris made his own pit stop a few laps later; but it was a slow one, and Norris rejoined the race just ahead of Russell and seven seconds back from Verstappen. Over the closing laps, Norris ate into Verstappen's lead, but was unable to get close eough to attempt an overtake. Verstappen therefore won by 2.2 seconds from Norris; with Hamilton claiming third after overtaking Russell in the closing stages. Russell finished ahead of Leclerc and Sainz.\\n[\\n135\\n]\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nThe result saw Verstappen extend his championship lead to 69 points. Norris moved into second ahead of Leclerc. In the constructor's championship, Red Bull's lead increased to 60 points over Ferrari, with McLaren a further 33 back.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThe\\nAustrian Grand Prix\\nfeatured the third sprint of the season. Verstappen took pole position for the sprint, which he proceeded to win ahead of the McLarens of Piastri and Norris. Verstappen also took pole position for the main race and was on course to win after leading the majority of it, but Norris soon closed the gap to him after a slow pit stop for Verstappen, who was now on older tyres with Norris having a tyre advantage. After multiple laps battling for the lead, Verstappen and Norris made contact, marking Norris' second retirement of the season following the Miami Grand Prix sprint, and Verstappen dropped down to fifth after a puncture. Russell benefited from the two making contact to take his second career victory, and Mercedes' second victory in the ground effect era, after the\\n2022 S\\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix\\n. He was joined on the podium by Piastri and Sainz.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nRussell took pole position for the\\nBritish Grand Prix\\nand led the first half of the race, which was held under intermittent rain, before retiring due to a water cooling issue. Norris inherited the lead after passing Russell, but he lost time switching to soft tyres after the period of rain had ended. Hamilton took advantage of this to inherit the lead as Norris' soft tyres began to degrade, allowing Verstappen, who was on hard tyres, to overtake him. By the end of the race, Verstappen began to close in on Hamilton, but the latter held on to take his first victory since the\\n2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix\\n. Following Russell's victory at the Austrian Grand Prix a week earlier, Mercedes won consecutive Grands Prix for the first time since 2021. Hamilton's victory was the 104th of his career, and his ninth\\nBritish Grand Prix\\nvictory, which also broke the record he shared with\\nMichael Schumacher\\nfor most Grand Prix wins at a single circuit. This made Hamilton the first driver to win after his 300th start.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\nMcLaren\\ndrivers\\nLando Norris\\n(left) and\\nOscar Piastri\\n(right) claimed their maiden wins at the\\nMiami\\nand\\nHungarian\\nGrands Prix, respectively.\\nNorris and Piastri locked out the front row at the\\nHungarian Grand Prix\\n, which was McLaren's first front-row lockout since the\\n2012 Brazilian Grand Prix\\n. Piastri led a majority of the race before Norris gained the lead via an\\nundercut\\n. McLaren invoked\\nteam orders\\non Norris, telling him to slow down and let Piastri by to take his maiden Grand Prix victory and McLaren's first 1\\u20132 finish since the\\n2021 Italian Grand Prix\\n, where Norris had also finished second to his teammate. The result meant they overtook Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. Hamilton, having battled with Verstappen for the majority of the race, finished in third for his 200th career Formula One podium, and Verstappen, who criticised the car's pace and strategy options, ended up finishing in fifth after colliding with Hamilton. Meanwhile, P\\u00e9rez, who was knocked out of Q1 after crashing out, recovered from sixteenth to seventh.\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nVerstappen qualified fastest for the\\nBelgian Grand Prix\\n, but took a grid penalty leaving second-fastest Leclerc on pole position. Hamilton jumped P\\u00e9rez off the line and overtook Leclerc in the opening laps to take the lead of the race before Russell shuffled into the lead following pit stops. Russell was running older hard tyres, but brought the car home without any further pit stops to take what was initially a victory ahead of Hamilton and Piastri. Russell was later disqualified post-race due to having an underweight car, promoting Hamilton to victory, Piastri to second and Leclerc to the podium.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\nThe\\nDutch Grand Prix\\nmarked the first race following the summer break. Norris took pole position for the race, but lost out to second-placed Verstappen at the start. Norris caught up to, and passed Verstappen and went on to win his second Grand Prix, by over twenty-two seconds, ahead of Verstappen; Leclerc completed a one-stop strategy to finish in third. Norris's victory marked McLaren's first at the venue since\\nNiki Lauda\\n's triumph in\\n1985\\n, and ended a three-year streak of Verstappen victories at the\\nCircuit Zandvoort\\nsince its reintroduction to the Formula One calendar in\\n2021\\n.\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nAt the\\nItalian Grand Prix\\n, Norris and Piastri locked-out the front row for McLaren ahead of third-placed Russell with the Ferraris in fourth and fifth. Norris lost out at turn four to Piastri, and Russell sustained front-wing damage. Most teams opted to run a two-stop strategy, but Ferrari opted to run a one-stop strategy which Leclerc initially criticised. The one-stop strategy would pay off eventually, with Leclerc cycling into the lead ahead of Piastri. Leclerc kept his lead until the chequered flag was flown to win the Grand Prix, scoring Ferrari's first victory at their home race since\\n2019\\n, which was also won by Leclerc. Piastri and Norris, the latter scoring the fastest lap on lap 53, rounded off the podium. The race also saw the debut of\\nFranco Colapinto\\nfor Williams, the team replacing\\nLogan Sargeant\\nfor the rest of the season. Colapinto finished twelfth in his debut race.\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nAt the\\nBelgian Grand Prix\\n,\\nGeorge Russell\\nbecame the first driver to be disqualified from a Grand Prix victory since\\nMichael Schumacher\\nin the\\n1994 edition\\nof the race.\\nClosing rounds\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAt the\\nAzerbaijan Grand Prix\\n, Leclerc took the pole position ahead of Piastri and Sainz, while Verstappen qualified sixth and Norris down in 17th. Norris would make up two places after Hamilton and Ocon were relegated to a pit lane start for changing power unit components during\\nparc ferm\\u00e9\\n. In the race, Leclerc maintained his lead off the line with Piastri in second, ahead of P\\u00e9rez in third. The front-runners started on the medium tyres before swapping them for hards. The leading trio maintained their places, closely following each other after the round of pit stops. Piastri took the lead on lap 20 and defended it against Leclerc for the rest of the race to take his second victory. P\\u00e9rez and Sainz, while battling for third, crashed on the penultimate lap, which elevated Russell to the last podium spot. Norris, who initially started fifteenth, finished fourth ahead of his championship rival Verstappen and also took the fastest lap. Colapinto, who had made his debut in the previous race, scored the first points of his Formula One career, after finishing eighth; this made him the first\\nArgentine\\ndriver to score a point since\\nCarlos Reutemann\\nat the\\n1982 South African Grand Prix\\n. Bearman, who returned as a replacement for the banned Magnussen at Haas, took the final point, becoming the first driver in history to score for two different teams in his first two races. McLaren took the lead of the Constructors' Championship from Red Bull, leading it for the first time since the\\n2014 Australian Grand Prix\\n. This also marked the first time a non-Red Bull team led the Constructors' Championship since the\\n2022 Miami Grand Prix\\n.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nAt the\\nSingapore Grand Prix\\n, Norris took pole position, led all laps, and won comfortably ahead of Verstappen and Piastri. However, he was denied his first grand slam by\\nRB\\ndriver\\nDaniel Ricciardo\\nwho set the fastest lap of the race,\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nin what would turn out to be his final Grand Prix before departing the team days later and being replaced by\\nLiam Lawson\\n.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nAt the\\nUnited States Grand Prix\\n, Verstappen took pole position for the sprint, led all laps, and won comfortably ahead of Sainz and Norris who took pole position for the main race ahead of Verstappen and Sainz. Fourth-placed\\nCharles Leclerc\\ntook the race lead on lap one and went on to win. Leclerc finished ahead of teammate Sainz for a Ferrari 1\\u20132, and Norris finished third on track before being dropped to fourth behind championship rival Verstappen due to receiving a penalty.\\nLewis Hamilton\\nendured a bad Grand Prix, suffering a Q1 exit and early retirement from the race, while teammate\\nGeorge Russell\\ncrashed out in qualifying, started in the pit lane, and finished in sixth. On\\nLiam Lawson\\n's first race of the season, he endured a grid penalty which meant he started 19th, and recovered ten places to finish in ninth.\\nEsteban Ocon\\nscored the fastest lap, obtaining the first of his Formula One career and Alpine's first ever fastest lap on his 152nd start.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nAt the\\nMexico City Grand Prix\\n, Sainz took pole position for the race, but briefly lost the lead to second-placed Verstappen. He passed the lead Red Bull, who would later receive two separate ten-second time penalties for forcing Norris off-track and gaining an advantage. Sainz led all laps from lap nine onwards to take a comfortable win, the second consecutive for Ferrari, and the fourth win of his career. Leclerc was running in second for the majority of the race before he survived a near-encounter with a wall that allowed Norris to pass him for second. Leclerc got the fastest lap, while P\\u00e9rez's home race ended in him qualifying eighteenth, fighting with sister team driver Lawson, and finishing last of the finishers. Three cars retired: Alonso on his 400th Grand Prix entry, along with Albon and Tsunoda, following a lap one tussle that ended with both retiring. The success of Ferrari allowed them to pass Red Bull for second in the Constructors' Championship.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe season would be the twelfth and final year for\\nLewis Hamilton\\nat\\nMercedes\\n, with whom he holds\\nseveral records\\nincluding most races, wins, and championships with a single constructor.\\nAt the\\nS\\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix\\n, Piastri took pole in sprint qualifying, with Norris second, Leclerc third, and Verstappen fourth. The top four kept the position they started in for the first 17 laps, until Verstappen passed Leclerc for third on lap 18. On lap 20, H\\u00fclkenberg retired due to a mechanical failure, necessitating a virtual safety car. Shortly before the virtual safety car was deployed, McLaren swapped their cars, putting Norris into the lead. Norris finished the sprint first, ahead of Piastri, and Verstappen. However, Verstappen later received a five-second time penalty for a virtual safety car infringement, dropping him to fourth, which promoted Leclerc to the final podium spot. The points positions were completed by Sainz, Russell, Gasly, and P\\u00e9rez.\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nQualifying was postponed from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning due to heavy rain. Norris took pole position during a session disrupted by five red flags, ahead of Russell in second.\\nYuki Tsunoda\\nqualified in third, the highest starting position ever for him and his team\\nRB\\n. The race was held four hours after qualifying. Before the start, Williams were unable to repair Albon's car on time after he crashed out in qualifying, and Stroll was stuck in the run-off area on the formation lap after an unsuccessful attempt of rejoining the track, forcing both drivers out of the race. Russell held the lead for the first half of the race before H\\u00fclkenberg spun, bringing out a virtual safety car. Russell and Norris pitted in response, which allowed\\nEsteban Ocon\\nto inherit the lead ahead of Verstappen and teammate\\nPierre Gasly\\n. Heavy rain soon brought out the safety car, which turned into a red flag on lap 32 as Colapinto crashed in the last corner. Racing resumed again for a short period before Sainz spun into the barrier on lap 39, which brought out another safety car. The subsequent restart allowed Verstappen to take the lead from Ocon, while Norris dropped down to seventh after going off-track. He later was let past by his teammate Piastri, who received a ten-second penalty earlier for causing a collision with Lawson. Verstappen took his first victory in ten races after starting from seventeenth on the grid. He was joined on the podium by Ocon and Gasly, marking\\nAlpine\\n's first-ever double podium and their first podiums of the season.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nVerstappen had a chance to secure his fourth\\nWorld Drivers' Championship\\ntitle at the\\nLas Vegas Grand Prix\\n, with him being able to do so as long as he outscored Norris.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nRussell took pole position and led a majority of the race from lights to flag, leading Hamilton, who endured a poor qualification, behind him. Russell secured his second win of the season, and this is the first time Russell won more than one Grand Prix in a single season. Additionally, Sainz and Leclerc finished in third and fourth, respectively, bridging closer Ferrari's gap to McLaren in the Constructors' Championship. Verstappen qualified and finished in fifth, with Norris behind him in sixth, allowing him to clinch his fourth consecutive title. Two retirements were observed, both due to mechanical issues:\\nPierre Gasly\\n, who endured his best qualification of the season in third, and\\nAlexander Albon\\ndue to overheating. Albon's teammate\\nFranco Colapinto\\nstarted from the pit lane after enduring a heavy crash in qualifying.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\nMcLaren had a chance to secure its ninth\\nWorld Constructors' Championship\\ntitle, the first since\\n1998\\n, at the\\nQatar Grand Prix\\n. McLaren could win the title as long as they outscored Ferrari and Red Bull in Sunday's race. Sprint polesitter Norris finished behind winner Piastri, for what was to be the final sprint of the season. Verstappen set the fastest time in qualifying, but was demoted one position after the stewards deemed him to have driven unnecessarily slowly on a preparation lap, allowing Russell to inherit pole position. At the start of the race, Verstappen took the lead off Russell, which he held to win the race. Meanwhile, at the back,\\nEsteban Ocon\\n, in his final race with Alpine, was hit into Colapinto by H\\u00fclkenberg, creating a hole in his sidepod and forcing both Ocon and Colapinto to retire from the race. Colapinto's teammate Albon was hit by\\nLance Stroll\\n, the latter of whom later retired. Lawson joined Albon in spinning and was awarded a penalty after hitting\\nValtteri Bottas\\n; additionally, Hamilton received a penalty due to a false start. Albon's right wing mirror became detached from his car, resulting in double-waved yellow flags. The mirror was hit by Bottas, resulting in debris being scattered across the track. Hamilton and Sainz developed front-left punctures, although telemetry subsequently showed both drivers were seeing falling tyre pressure before passing the debris-covered area.\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nNorris was given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty due to failing to slow under yellow flags, and Hamilton a drive-through for speeding in the pit lane.\\nZhou Guanyu\\nfinished eighth, earning him four points; both his and\\nSauber\\n's first points of the season. Despite Verstappen's victory, Red Bull dropped out of contention for the Constructors' Championship.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\nDue to McLaren not scoring enough points in Qatar, the battle for the Constructors' Championship came down to the\\nAbu Dhabi Grand Prix\\n, with Ferrari winning their first since\\n2008\\nif they outscored McLaren. Norris took pole and controlled the race to take his fourth career victory, which meant McLaren successfully secured their first Constructors' Championship since\\n1998\\n. Meanwhile, Leclerc started 19th and Sainz in third on his last race for Ferrari behind Norris' teammate Piastri, and Leclerc recovered to third behind Sainz while Piastri dropped to the back after a collision with Verstappen, which handed the latter a penalty; Piastri recovered to tenth. On Hamilton's last race for Mercedes, he started sixteenth after a team error during qualifying, but managed to recover to fourth after passing his teammate on the final lap. Of the four retirees, P\\u00e9rez retired for the second time in three races due to hitting Bottas, Colapinto retired due to engine issues, Bottas struck Magnussen and broke his own suspension, and Lawson's brakes caught fire on the closing stages of the race.\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nResults and standings\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nGrands Prix\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nRound\\nGrand Prix\\n[\\nf\\n]\\nPole position\\nFastest lap\\nWinning driver\\nWinning constructor\\nReport\\n1\\nBahrain Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nMax Verstappen\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n2\\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nCharles Leclerc\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n3\\nAustralian Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nCharles Leclerc\\nCarlos Sainz Jr.\\nFerrari\\nReport\\n4\\nJapanese Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nMax Verstappen\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n5\\nChinese Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nFernando Alonso\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n6\\nMiami Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nOscar Piastri\\nLando Norris\\nMcLaren\\n-\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n7\\nEmilia Romagna Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nGeorge Russell\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n8\\nMonaco Grand Prix\\nCharles Leclerc\\nLewis Hamilton\\nCharles Leclerc\\nFerrari\\nReport\\n9\\nCanadian Grand Prix\\nGeorge Russell\\nLewis Hamilton\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n10\\nSpanish Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nLando Norris\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n11\\nAustrian Grand Prix\\nMax Verstappen\\nFernando Alonso\\nGeorge Russell\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n12\\nBritish Grand Prix\\nGeorge Russell\\nCarlos Sainz Jr.\\nLewis Hamilton\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n13\\nHungarian Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nGeorge Russell\\nOscar Piastri\\nMcLaren\\n-\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n14\\nBelgian Grand Prix\\nCharles Leclerc\\n[\\ng\\n]\\nSergio P\\u00e9rez\\nLewis Hamilton\\n[\\nh\\n]\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n15\\nDutch Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nLando Norris\\nLando Norris\\nMcLaren\\n-\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n16\\nItalian Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nLando Norris\\nCharles Leclerc\\nFerrari\\nReport\\n17\\nAzerbaijan Grand Prix\\nCharles Leclerc\\nLando Norris\\nOscar Piastri\\nMcLaren\\n-\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n18\\nSingapore Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nDaniel Ricciardo\\nLando Norris\\nMcLaren\\n-\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n19\\nUnited States Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nEsteban Ocon\\nCharles Leclerc\\nFerrari\\nReport\\n20\\nMexico City Grand Prix\\nCarlos Sainz Jr.\\nCharles Leclerc\\nCarlos Sainz Jr.\\nFerrari\\nReport\\n21\\nS\\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nMax Verstappen\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n22\\nLas Vegas Grand Prix\\nGeorge Russell\\nLando Norris\\nGeorge Russell\\nMercedes\\nReport\\n23\\nQatar Grand Prix\\nGeorge Russell\\n[\\ni\\n]\\nLando Norris\\nMax Verstappen\\nRed Bull Racing\\n-\\nHonda RBPT\\nReport\\n24\\nAbu Dhabi Grand Prix\\nLando Norris\\nKevin Magnussen\\nLando Norris\\nMcLaren\\n-\\nMercedes\\nReport\\nSource:\\n[\\n54\\n]\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nScoring system\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nFurther information:\\nList of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems\\nPoints were awarded to the top ten classified drivers, the driver who set the fastest lap during the Grand Prix (only if one of the top ten), and the top eight of the\\nsprint\\n.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\n[\\nj\\n]\\nIn the case of a tie on points, a countback system was used where the driver with the most Grand Prix wins is ranked higher.

Thanks to their continued reports and the work of explorers and artists who followed, the United States Congress established Yellowstone National Park in 1872.\\nNPS / Thomas Moran, YELL 29\\nThe crowning achievement of the returning expeditions was helping to save Yellowstone from private development. Langford and several of his companions promoted a bill in Washington in late 1871 and early 1872 that drew upon the precedent of the Yosemite Act of 1864, which reserved Yosemite Valley from settlement and entrusted it to the care of the state of California. To permanently close to settlement an expanse of the public domain the size of Yellowstone would depart from the established policy of transferring public lands to private ownership. But the wonders of Yellowstone\\u2014shown through Jackson\\u2019s photographs, Moran\\u2019s paintings, and Elliot\\u2019s sketches\\u2014had captured the imagination of Congress. Thanks to their reports, the United States Congress established Yellowstone National Park just six months after the Hayden Expedition. On March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act into law. The world\\u2019s first national park was born.\\nThe Yellowstone National Park Protection Act says \\u201cthe headwaters of the Yellowstone River \\u2026 is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale \\u2026 and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\\u201d In an era of expansion, the federal government had the foresight to set aside land deemed too valuable in natural wonders to develop.\\nDid other national parks exist before Yellowstone?\\nSome sources list Hot Springs in Arkansas as the first national park. Set aside in 1832, forty years before Yellowstone was established in 1872, it was actually the nation\\u2019s oldest national reservation, set aside to preserve and distribute a utilitarian resource (hot water), much like our present national forests. In 1921, an act of Congress established Hot Springs as a national park.\\nYosemite became a park before Yellowstone, but as a state park. Disappointed with the results 26 years later in 1890, Congress made Yosemite one of three additional national parks, along with Sequoia and General Grant, now part of Kings Canyon. Mount Rainier followed in 1899.\\nAs an older state park, Yosemite did have a strong influence on the founding of Yellowstone in 1872 because Congress actually used language in the state park act as a model. It\\u2019s entirely possible that Congress may have preferred to make Yellowstone a state park in the same fashion as Yosemite, had it not been for an accident of geography that put it within three territorial boundaries. Arguments between Wyoming and Montana territories that year resulted in a decision to federalize Yellowstone.\\nAs Yellowstone\\u2019s second superintendent, Philetus Norris set the future course of national parks in protection, addressing visitors\\u2019 needs and interests, and science-based management. Despite a lack of support from the Department of the Interior or Congress, he pleaded for protection legislation.\\nNPS\\nFormative Years\\nThe park\\u2019s promoters envisioned Yellowstone National Park would exist at no expense to the government. Nathaniel P. Langford, member of the Washburn Expedition and advocate of the Yellowstone National Park Act, was appointed to the unpaid post of superintendent. (He earned his living elsewhere.) He entered the park at least twice during five years in office\\u2014as part of the 1872 Hayden Expedition and to evict a squatter in 1874. Langford did what he could without laws protecting wildlife and other natural features, and without money to build basic structures and hire law enforcement rangers.\\nPolitical pressure forced Langford\\u2019s removal in 1877. Philetus W. Norris was appointed the second superintendent, and the next year, Congress authorized appropriations \\u201cto protect, preserve, and improve the Park.\\u201d\\nNorris constructed roads, built a park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs, hired the first \\u201cgamekeeper,\\u201d and campaigned against hunters and vandals. Much of the primitive road system he laid out remains as the Grand Loop Road. Through constant exploration, Norris also added immensely to geographical knowledge of the park.\\nNorris\\u2019s tenure occurred during an era of warfare between the United States and many Native American tribes. To reassure the public that they faced no threat from these conflicts, he promoted the idea that Native Americans shunned this area because they feared the hydrothermal features, especially the geysers. This idea belied evidence to the contrary, but the myth endured.\\nNorris fell victim to political maneuvering and was removed from his post in 1882. He was succeeded by three ineffectual superintendents who could not protect the park. Even when ten assistant superintendents were authorized to act as police, they failed to stop the destruction of wildlife. Poachers, squatters, woodcutters, and vandals ravaged Yellowstone.\\nFlight of the Nez Perce (Nimi'ipu)\\nSummer 1877 brought tragedy to the Nez Perce (Nimi'ipu).\\nSoldiers pose with bison heads captured from poacher Ed Howell. When Howell returned to the park that year, he was the first person arrested and punished under the National Park Protection Act, passed in 1894.\\nNPS\\nThe Army Arrives\\nIn 1886 Congress refused to appropriate money for ineffective administration.The Secretary of the Interior, under authority given by the Congress, called on the Secretary of War for assistance. On August 20, 1886, the US Army took charge of Yellowstone. The Army strengthened, posted, and enforced regulations in the park. Troops guarded the major attractions and evicted troublemakers, and cavalry patrolled the vast interior.\\nThe most persistent menace came from poachers, whose activities threatened to exterminate animals such as the bison. In 1894, soldiers arrested a man named Ed Howell for slaughtering bison in Pelican Valley. The maximum sentence possible was banishment from the park. Emerson Hough, a well-known journalist, was present at the arrest and wired his report to\\nForest & Stream\\n, a popular magazine of the time. Its editor, renowned naturalist George Bird Grinnell, helped create a national outcry. Within two months Congress passed the National Park Protection Act, which increased the Army\\u2019s authority for protecting park treasures. (This law is known as the Lacey Act, and is the first of two laws with this name.)\\nRunning a park was not the Army\\u2019s usual line of work. The troops could protect the park and ensure access, but they could not fully satisfy the visitor\\u2019s desire for knowledge. Moreover, each of the 14 other national parks established in the late 1800s and early 1900s was separately administered, resulting in uneven management, inefficiency, and a lack of direction.\\nYellowstone Superintendent Horace Albright, shown here with future president Herbert Hoover in 1928, was involved in the creation of the National Park Service. Later, as agency\\u2019s director, he greatly increased the number of parks east of the Mississippi and helped preserve historic sites.\\nNPS\\nThe National Park Service Begins\\nNational parks clearly needed coordinated administration by professionals attuned to the special requirements of these preserves. The management of Yellowstone from 1872 through the early 1900s helped set the stage for the creation of an agency whose sole purpose was to manage the national parks. Promoters of this idea gathered support from influential journalists, railroads likely to profit from increased park tourism, and members of Congress. The National Park Service Organic Act was passed by Congress and approved by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.\\nYellowstone\\u2019s first rangers, which included veterans of Army service in the park, became responsible for Yellowstone in 1918. The park\\u2019s first superintendent under the new National Park Service was Horace M. Albright, who served simultaneously as assistant to Stephen T. Mather, Director of the National Park Service. Albright established a management framework that guided administration of Yellowstone for decades.\\nThis box represents the original boundary of Yellowstone National Park. Adjustments were made in 1929 and 1932.\\nNPS\\nBoundary Adjustments\\nAlmost as soon as the park was established, people began suggesting that the boundaries be revised to conform more closely to natural topographic features, such as the ridgeline of the Absaroka Range along the east boundary. Although these people had the ear of influential politicians, so did their opponents\\u2014 which at one time included the United States Forest Service. Eventually a compromise was reached, and, in 1929, President Hoover signed the first bill changing the park\\u2019s boundaries: The northwest corner now included a significant area of petrified trees; the northeast corner was defined by the watershed of Pebble Creek; the eastern boundary included the headwaters of the Lamar River and part of the watershed of the Yellowstone River. (The Yellowstone\\u2019s headwaters remain outside the park in Bridger-Teton National Forest.)\\nIn 1932, President Hoover issued an executive order that added more than 7,000 acres between the north boundary and the Yellowstone River, west of Gardiner. These lands provided winter range for elk and other ungulates.\\nEfforts to exploit the park also expanded during this time. Water users, from the town of Gardiner to the potato farmers of Idaho, wanted the park\\u2019s water. Proposals included damming the southwest corner of the park\\u2014the Bechler region. The failure of these schemes confirmed that Yellowstone\\u2019s wonders were so special that they should be forever preserved from exploitation.\\nGuidance for Protecting Yellowstone\\nVarious legislation provides guidance for protecting Yellowstone National Park.\\nWorld War II\\nWorld War II drew away employees, visitors, and money from all national parks, including Yellowstone. The money needed to maintain the park\\u2019s facilities, much less construct new ones, was directed to the war effort. Among other projects, the road from Old Faithful to Craig Pass was unfinished. Proposals again surfaced to use the park\\u2019s natural resources\\u2014this time in the war effort. As before, the park\\u2019s wonders were preserved.\\nVisitation jumped as soon as the war ended. By 1948, park visitation reached one million people per year. The park\\u2019s budget did not keep pace, and the neglect of the war years quickly caught up with the park.\\nMission 66\\nNeglected during World War II, the infrastructure in national parks continued to deteriorate as visitation soared afterward, leading to widespread complaints. In 1955, National Park Service Director Conrad Wirth persuaded Congress to fund an improvement program for completion by the National Park Service\\u2019s 50th anniversary in 1966. Although also designed to increase education programs and employee housing, Mission 66 focused mainly on visitor facilities and roads. Trained as an architect, Wirth encouraged the use of modern materials and prefabricated components to quickly and inexpensively construct low-maintenance buildings. This architectural style, which became known as Park Service Modern, was a deliberate departure from the picturesque, rustic buildings associated with national parks; their \\u201cfantasy land\\u201d quality was considered outmoded and too labor-intensive for the needed scale of construction.\\nMission 66 revitalized many national parks; in Yellowstone, intended to be the program\\u2019s showpiece, its legacy is still visible. It was a momentous chapter in the park\\u2019s history, and as the park continues to reflect changing ideas about how to enhance the visitor experience while protecting the natural and cultural resources, the question of how to preserve the story of Mission 66 is being addressed.\\nWork in Yellowstone included the development of Canyon Village. Aging visitor use facilities were replaced with modernistic visitor use facilities designed to reflect American attitudes of the 1950s. Visitor services were arranged around a large parking plaza with small cabins a short distance away. The first Mission 66 project initiated by the National Park Service, Canyon Village opened in July 1957.\\nThe Earliest Humans in Yellowstone\\nHuman occupation of this area seems to follow environmental changes of the last 15,000 years.\\nHistoric Tribes\\nMany tribes have a traditional connection to this region and its resources.\\nEuropean Americans Arrive\\nIn the late 1700s, fur traders traveled the Yellowstone River in search of Native Americans with whom to trade.\\nExpeditions Explore Yellowstone\\nFormal expeditions mapped and explored the area, leading to the nation's understanding of the region.\\nTimeline of Human History in Yellowstone\\nThe human history of the Yellowstone region goes back more than 11,000 years.\\nModern Management\\nManaging the national park has evolved over time and dealt with some complex issues.\\nToday's National Park Service\\nThe National Park Service manages over 80 million acres in all 50 states, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa.\\nPark History\\nLearn about Yellowstone's story from the earliest humans to today.\\nLast updated: September 22, 2025\\nPark footer\\nContact Info\\nMailing Address:\\nPO Box 168\\nYellowstone National Park,\\nWY\\n82190-0168\\nPhone:\\n307-344-7381\\nContact Us\\nTools\\nFAQ\\nSite Index\\nEspa\\u00f1ol\\nStay Connected\\nThis Site\\nAll NPS\\nExperience Your America.\\nDownload the NPS app to navigate the parks on the go.\\nNational Park Service\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\nAccessibility\\nPrivacy Policy\\nFOIA\\nNotices\\nContact The National Park Service\\nNPS FAQ\\nNo Fear Act\\nDisclaimer\\nVulnerability Disclosure Policy\\nUSA.gov\"}"}], "step_4": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': '1872', 'context': 'The first national park, Yellowstone National Park, was established in 1872.

In the end, the Peregrine spacecraft never left the (highly elliptical) Earth orbit it was injected into by the carrier rocket, and the mission ended ten days later (after one orbit) on 18 January when the spacecraft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere (under control of the mission team) and was destroyed.\\nSLIM\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nSLIM\\nachieved the first-ever lunar soft landing for a Japanese spacecraft.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIt landed on 19 January 2024 at 15:20 UTC, making Japan the 5th country to soft land on the Moon.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough it landed successfully, it landed on its side with the solar panels oriented westwards facing opposite the Sun at the start of\\nlunar day\\n, thereby failing to generate enough power.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lander operated on an internal battery power, which was fully drained that day.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nIrrespective of this solar array issue on lander, the two LEV 1 and 2 rovers, deployed during hovering just before final landing worked as expected, with LEV-1 communicating independently to the ground stations.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nLEV-1 conducted seven hops over 107 minutes on lunar surface. Images taken by LEV-2 show the wrong attitude landing with loss of an engine nozzle during descent and even possible sustained damage to lander's Earth bound antenna, that is not pointed towards Earth.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIrrespective of wrong attitude and loss of communication with the lander, the mission was fully successful after confirmation of its primary goal landing within 100\\u00a0m (330\\u00a0ft) of its landing spot was already achieved.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\n[\\n21\\n]\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nOn 29 January, the lander resumed operations after being shut down for a week. JAXA said it re-established contact with the lander and its solar cells were working again after a shift in lighting conditions allowed it to catch sunlight.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nAfter that, SLIM was put in sleep mode for impending harsh\\nlunar night\\n. While SLIM was expected to operate only for one lunar daylight period, or 14 Earth days, with its on-board electronics not designed to withstand the \\u2212120\\u00a0\\u00b0C (\\u2212184\\u00a0\\u00b0F) nighttime temperatures on the Moon, it managed to survive 3 lunar nights, waking up on 25 February, 27 March and 24 April respectively, sending back more data and images.

Though it landed successfully, one of the lander's legs broke upon landing and it tilted up on other side, 18\\u00b0 due to landing on a slope, but the lander survived and payloads were functioning as expected.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nJust before landing, at approximately 30\\u00a0m (98\\u00a0ft) above the lunar surface, the\\nOdysseus\\nlander was planned to eject the\\nEagleCam\\ncamera-equipped\\nCubeSat\\n, which would have been dropped onto the lunar surface near the lander, with an impact velocity of about 10\\u00a0m/s (22\\u00a0mph). However, due to complications arising from the software patch, it was decided that EagleCam would not be ejected upon landing. It was later ejected on 28 February returning all types of data, except post IM-1 landing images that were the main aim of its mission.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n[\\n30\\n]\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nThe lander also includes the\\nLunar Library\\nthat contains a version of the\\nEnglish Wikipedia\\n, artworks, selections from the\\nInternet Archive\\n, portions of the\\nProject Gutenberg\\n, and more.

However, it's worth noting that she\\ncurrently focuses on her education, pursuing her studies at a university in\\nBrazil. Livia does not occupy a board seat or hold any executive position at\\nWEG.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n\\n\\nLivia Voigt's remarkable achievement is not the only highlight in her family's\\nsuccess story. Her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, aged 26, has also made\\nwaves by earning a coveted spot on the youngest billionaire list. Dora, who\\nobtained her architecture degree in 2020, adds to the family's entrepreneurial\\nlegacy and reinforces the trend of youthful wealth accumulation.\\n\\n## Livia Voigt's net worth and global recognition\\n\\nWith a net worth soaring to $1.1 billion, Livia Voigt's inclusion in the elite\\ncircle of billionaires underscores her remarkable entrepreneurial journey at a\\ntender age. Alongside her sister Dora, Livia represents one of the seven new\\nfaces in the youngest [billionaire list](https://marketrealist.com/what-is-\\nsalma-hayeks-net-worth/https://marketrealist.com/who-is-austrian-billionaire-\\nmark-mateschitz-622879/) of 2024.

With her family's legacy deeply intertwined with\\nWEG's success, Livia's trajectory promises continued growth and influence in\\nthe realm of international business.\\n\\nEarlier the title of Youngest Billionaire was held by Clemente Del Vecchio,\\nwho, at the age of 19, was the youngest billionaire to grace the renowned\\nroster. Born into the illustrious Del Vecchio family, Clemente's journey to\\nwealth began with the passing of his father, Italian billionaire Leonardo Del\\nVecchio, former chairman of EssilorLuxottica, the world's largest eyeglasses\\nfirm, at the age of 87 in June last year. Clemente ascended to billionaire\\nstatus at the tender age of 18, inheriting a significant 12.5% stake in his\\nfather's esteemed holding company, Delfin, headquartered in Luxembourg. With a\\nnet worth currently estimated at $4 billion by Forbes, Clemente's wealth\\nsolidified his position as a prominent figure in the world of finance and\\nentrepreneurship. He harbors aspirations of pursuing higher education and\\ncarving out a career in these fields.\\n\\n[

For the top tier of Hollywood talent, acting in a film has become just one element of a multi-year, multi-platform partnership between a studio and an actor to develop, produce, and most importantly market a project to audiences.\\nThose who have proven their ability to personally convert fans into customers have become more valuable than ever before. Johnson\\u2019s contract for\\nRed One\\n, which included up-front fees for acting and producing\\u2014as well as a buyout of back-end participation for both roles\\u2014will pay him an estimated $50 million, believed to be the highest fee-plus-buyout total in history for a single movie.\\nWhen combined with Johnson\\u2019s impressive deal for\\nMoana 2\\nand his catalog of older titles, he earned an estimated $88 million last year (after paying fees to his agent and lawyer), making him the highest-paid actor of 2024.\\nRight on his heels is Ryan Reynolds, who, similarly, was the lead producer, co-writer and star of the year\\u2019s biggest live-action theatrical hit,\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n. He even produced commercials for the movie through his marketing agency, Maximum Effort. Reynolds\\u2019 busy year was rewarded with an estimated $85 million (after fees), though in the end 2024 might be remembered for the\\nswarm of lawsuits between his wife, Blake Lively, and\\nIt Ends With Us\\nfilmmaker Justin Baldoni\\n, which have seen his name littered throughout court documents.\\nClose behind Johnson and Reynolds, in third place, is another power promoter\\u2014Kevin Hart, whose unrivaled volume of self-produced movies, TV shows, podcasts and stand-up comedy continues to reinforce his status as the hardest-working man in show business, and brought in an estimated $81 million.\\nThose three multi-hyphenates earned the same amount as the rest of the top 10 combined, lapping veteran movie stars like Brad Pitt ($32 million), Nicole Kidman ($31 million) and\\n2023\\u2019s highest-paid actor, Adam Sandler\\n($26 million)\\u2014none of whom come with their own built-in marketing machine.\\nStill, it pays to be an established hitmaker from a previous generation. The average age of the top 20, who combined for more than $730 million in earnings last year, is a little over 54 years old. These actors benefit not only from high salaries set by the precedent of past hits, they continue to receive sizable checks each year from those old projects, whether it be TV shows\\u2014\\nForbes\\nestimates Jerry Seinfeld (No. 4 this year) pockets $30 million each year for creating\\nSeinfeld\\u2014\\nor decades\\u2019 worth of movies. For example, Matt Damon (No. 16) earned an estimated $8 million last year in profit participations from his back catalog, which includes the\\nBourne\\nand\\nOcean\\u2019s\\nfranchises.\\nThat has made it difficult for new stars to enter the top echelon of pay in Hollywood.\\nLast year\\u2019s top 20\\ndoesn\\u2019t include any actors in their 20s or 30s (the youngest is Scarlett Johansson, 40, at No. 19), even after a breakout year for young stars like Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell and Zendaya. Their fees have jumped for future projects, say representatives around Hollywood, and they are among the hardest actors to book right now, but the consensus is that they will need to continue to prove that the success came as a direct result of their billing in order to achieve top earnings in future years.\\nEven Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet, 29, considered by the industry to be best positioned for mega-stardom, fell well short of this year\\u2019s list because his Oscar-nominated role as Bob Dylan in\\nA Complete Unknown\\nwas negotiated years ago, before\\nWonka\\nand\\nDune 2\\nturned him into a household name.\\nUnlike last year\\u2019s one-two punch of\\nBarbie\\nand\\nOppenheimer\\n, most of this year\\u2019s fortunes were made away from the box office. Six of the top 10 highest-grossing movies of 2024 were animated, an area of the business where actors generally don\\u2019t receive high salaries.\\nWith theatrical releases appearing increasingly risky, A-list talent instead flocked to streaming services, where so-called buyout deals are still the norm, paying talent a premium flat fee. In a competitive situation in which Apple, Amazon and Netflix are all vying for the same star-driven package, an actor might receive a total compensation well over the still-standard $20 million up-front fee for theatrical movies, as was the case with Pitt (No. 6) and George Clooney (No. 7) for\\nWolfs\\n.\\nWhether that trend continues, or whether the industry\\u2019s chants of \\u201csurvive to \\u201825\\u201d are rewarded with a box office renaissance this year, there remains an ironclad belief among agents, managers, lawyers and studio executives that movie stars are always going to be essential to the future of Hollywood.\\nUltimately, even more than the money earned, the annual list of the highest-paid actors represents a measure of the control that talent can wield within the industry, and how they choose to use it.\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#1.\\nDwayne Johnson\\n$88 million ($103 million gross)\\nThe Rock returned to the top of the\\nhighest-paid actors\\nlist after landing what is believed to be the largest fee-plus-buyout in streaming movie history, an estimated $50 million to star in Amazon's\\nRed One\\nlast year. And when\\nMoana 2\\npivoted from a TV series to a theatrical release, he negotiated for a percentage of the movie's profits as an executive producer, an unprecedented deal for voice actors in Disney animation. After the movie grossed over $1 billion at the box office, Johnson, 52, made what one agent calls \\\"an ungodly amount of money.\\\"\\nTheo Wargo/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#2.\\nRyan Reynolds\\n$85 million ($100 million gross)\\nReynolds was the lead producer, co-writer and star of the biggest live action movie of the year in\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n, which grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide. But that was only part of a jam-packed year that included starring in John Krasinski's\\nIF\\n, producing a new season of\\nWelcome To Wrexham\\nfor Hulu, and depending on which version of the\\nBlake Lively-Justin Baldoni lawsuits\\nyou believe, reworking the script for his wife's movie\\nIt Ends With Us\\n.\\nAxelle/Bauer/Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#3. Kevin Hart\\n$81 million ($108 million gross)\\nNobody had a more diversified entertainment slate in 2024 than Hart, who starred in a theatrical release (\\nBorderlands\\n), a Netflix film (\\nLift\\n), an Amazon Prime movie (\\nDie Hart 2: Die Harter\\n), a series on The Roku Channel (\\nDie Hart\\nseason three), a series on Peacock (\\nFight Night\\n), the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix, a weekly podcast for SiriusXM (Gold Minds), not to mention 90 stand-up comedy shows. Add in commercial campaigns with DraftKings and Chase\\u2014not counted among his 2024 earnings\\u2014and you basically can't turn on any screen without seeing the 45-year-old comedian.\\nVictoria Will/Invision/AP\\n#\\n4.\\nJerry Seinfeld\\n$60 million ($70 million gross)\\nThe 70-year-old Seinfeld,\\nnamed a billionaire by\\nForbes\\nlast year, remains active on the stand-up circuit while his eponymous sitcom continues to bring in\\neight-figures every\\nyear. During the pandemic, he wrote a script spoofing the invention of Pop-Tarts,\\nUnfrosted\\n, which he eventually directed and starred in for Netflix last year.\\nDimitrios Kambouris/Vogue/Getty Images for The Met Museum\\n#5.\\nHugh Jackman\\n$50 million ($66 million gross)\\nAfter the emotional send-off of his Wolverine character in 2017's\\nLogan\\n, nothing short of a massive payday and the opportunity to work with his good friend Ryan Reynolds would have convinced the 56-year-old Jackman to don the adamantium claws once again. But\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\nwill likely end up being the most lucrative movie of his career.\\nTristan Fewings/Getty Images\\n#6. Brad Pitt\\n$32 million ($42 million gross)\\nAfter pulling\\nWolfs\\n(costarring his good friend George Clooney) from a theatrical release last year\\u2014opting to show it directly on AppleTV+\\u2014 Apple is betting the house on Pitt's 2025 movie\\nF1,\\nin theaters this summer. Meanwhile, his production company, Plan B, continues to be a juggernaut both at the box office (with\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice)\\nand on the awards circuit (backing longshot Best Picture nominee\\nNickel Boys)\\n.\\nGotham/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#7.\\nGeorge Clooney\\n$31 million ($37 million gross)\\nClooney publicly denied the reporting that he and Brad Pitt were paid $35 million each for the spy comedy\\nWolfs\\n\\u2014which he\\ncalled\\n\\\"bad for our industry if that\\u2019s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries\\u201d\\u2014but Apple had to outbid multiple suitors for the project in 2021. And compared to Clooney's directorial efforts or Pitt's more awards-inclined projects, one dealmaker tells\\nForbes\\nthe movie was \\\"definitely a for-profit endeavor for them.\\\"\\nStefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\n#8.\\nNicole Kidman\\n$31 million ($41 million gross)\\nThe reigning queen of AMC Theaters has become one of the most bankable stars in the TV miniseries space, starring in one for Netflix (\\nThe Perfect Couple\\n), one for Paramount+ (\\nLioness\\n), and one for Amazon (\\nExpats\\n) last year, making more than $1 million per episode in each. Add to that two movies featuring romances with much younger men\\u2014\\nBabygirl\\nand\\nA Family Affair\\n\\u2014and the 57-year-old Kidman is the highest-paid actress of 2024.\\nTodd Owyoung/NBC/Getty Images\\n#9.\\nAdam Sandler\\n$26 million ($35 million gross)\\nSandler's overall deal with Netflix is unrivaled in the industry, allowing him to make both big commercial projects like the upcoming\\nHappy Gilmore 2\\nor more modest fare like 2024's\\nSpaceman\\n, and\\nstill receive top dollar\\n. And the back catalog of last year\\u2019s highest-paid actor remains on the platform, racking up hundreds of millions of hours watched each year.\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\n#10.\\nWill Smith\\n$26 million ($30 million gross)\\nOpinions around Hollywood differ as to whether the 56-year-old Oscar winner is fully \\\"back\\\" after\\nThe Slap Seen \\u2018Round The World\\nin 2022, but all agree that returning to the character that first made him a star was as savvy move. And 2024\\u2019s\\nBad Boys: Ride or Die\\nwas a hit, one of less than 20 movies to gross more than $400 million worldwide last year.\\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images\\n#11.\\nMariska Hargitay\\n$25 million ($29 million gross)\\nAs the anchor for Dick Wolf\\u2019s\\nLaw & Order: SVU\\nfor more than 20 years and 550 episodes, the 61-year-old Hargitay is the highest-paid actor on television by a wide margin. She earns an estimated $750,000 per episode between acting and producing fees, as well as a slice of the show\\u2019s considerable syndication profits.\\nADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images\\n#12.\\nChanning Tatum\\n$24 million ($28 million gross)\\nDespite the box office failure of\\nFly Me To The Moon\\n, Tatum\\u2019s earnings were in the stratosphere last year, as his deal was structured with a straight-to-streaming buyout of back-end participation. The 44-year-old Tatum also starred in\\nBlink Twice\\n, directed by his then-girlfriend Zoe Kravitz, and made a long-rumored (yet short-lived)\\ncameo as Gambit\\nin\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n.\\nMike Marsland/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#13.\\nJason Statham\\n$24 million ($25 million gross)\\nStatham, 57, has proven to be box office Teflon in recent years, stringing together a series of modest hits playing regular-guy action heroes, including 2024\\u2019s\\nThe Beekeeper\\n. He can command $20 million or more for such roles, in some cases nearly half of the movie\\u2019s production budget, all while operating without the representation of an agent or manager.\\nJordan Strauss/Invision/AP\\n#14.\\nMark Wahlberg\\n$23 million ($31 million gross)\\nWhen Wahlberg isn\\u2019t busy\\nrunning multiple companies\\nand crushing 4 a.m. workouts, the 53-year-old actor divides his efforts on-screen between bigger budget action movies, usually at Netflix, as was the case with last year\\u2019s\\nThe Union\\n, and more personal independent projects like\\nArthur The King\\n.\\nAndreas Rentz/Getty Images\\n#15.\\nMatt Damon\\n$23 million ($30 million gross)\\nArtists Equity, the studio Damon cofounded with his longtime friend and collaborator Ben Affleck, continues to find willing buyers among the streaming services for projects produced by or starring the 54-year-old Oscar winner, including\\nThe Instigators\\nfor AppleTV+ in 2024. In addition to his up-front fees, Damon owns a piece of his movies\\u2019 equity, which sell at a premium price above their production budgets.\\nRebecca Cabage/Invision/AP\\n#16.\\nJohn Cena\\n$23 million ($30 million gross)\\nCurrently on his farewell tour with the WWE, his wrestling home since 2002, the 47-year-old Cena has continued to be a bankable presence in streaming comedies across platforms. In 2024 he starred in\\nArgylle\\nfor Apple,\\nRicky Stanicky\\nfor Hulu, and\\nJackpot!\\nfor Amazon, and made appearances in Kevin Hart\\u2019s\\nDie Hart 2\\nand in one episode of\\nThe Bear.\\nErik Voake/Getty Images for WarnerMedia\\n#17.\\nDenzel Washington\\n$23 million ($27 million gross)\\nA villainous turn in\\nGladiator II\\nnetted another sizable payday, though the 70-year-old Washington will have to do without the laurels of an 11th Oscar nomination, which many Hollywood pundits predicted was coming. He also continues to receive hefty checks from the dozens of hits in his 40-year back catalog.\\nGabriel Olsen/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#18.\\nJake Gyllenhaal\\n$22 million ($26 million gross)\\nGyllenhaal\\u2019s 2024 remake of\\nRoad House\\nreportedly\\nfaced a choice\\nbetween a $60 million budget and a theatrical release, or an $85 million budget to go straight to Amazon Prime Video. The latter meant a bigger up-front payday for its 44-year-old star, without the gamble on box office performance. And it wasn\\u2019t the only remake Gyllenhaal fronted last year, as\\nPresumed Innocent\\nbecame a hit series on AppleTV+.\\nCindy Ord/Getty Images\\n#19.\\nScarlett Johansson\\n$21 million ($25 million gross)\\nIn addition to\\nFly Me To The Moon\\n, which she costarred in with Channing Tatum, the 40-year-old actress lent her distinct voice to the lead role in the animated movie\\nTransformers One\\n. It\\u2019s a voice so distinct that Johansson said last May she\\nbelieves it was copied\\nby OpenAI for its chatbot.\\nEmma McIntyre/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\n#20.\\nJoaquin Phoenix\\n$19 million ($22 million gross)\\nReprising his Oscar-winning role as The Joker came with the biggest up-front fee of the 50-year-old Phoenix\\u2019s career, even though\\nJoker: Folie \\u00e0 Deux\\nbecame one of the biggest box office bombs of the year.\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nEstimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts, as well as data sources such as IMDBPro and Polestar. The figures represent pretax earnings for the calendar year 2024, minus fees for representation \\u2013 10% to agents, 10% to managers and 5% to lawyers, per industry standard, although some actors do not have all three.\\nActors were credited for all compensation on projects in the year they were released, despite the fact that often up front fees are paid when a movie is filmed, which could be years in the past, and back-end participation or buyouts are often paid several years into the future.\\nAdditionally, the ranking only includes earnings related to entertainment\\u2014acting, producing, directing, or other forms of performance (such as stand-up comedy). Entrepreneurial endeavors not related to entertainment, such as joint ventures, licensing, commercials or social media partnerships, were not counted.\\nMore from Forbes\\nForbes\\nWhy Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television\\nBy\\nMatt Craig\\nForbes\\nThe Highest-Paid TV Showrunners 2024\\nBy\\nMatt Craig\\nForbes\\nWhy This Film Financing Company Is The Safest Bet In Hollywood\\nBy\\nMatt Craig\\nGot a tip?

called it a \\\"sales slowdown\\\" in 2024. And indeed, sales of all-electric\\nvehicles haven't taken off as quickly as the auto industry's once-optimistic\\nprojections. But EVs still made up a record 8.1% of new-car purchases in the\\nU.S. last year at 1.3 million units moved and sales are continuing to grow.\\n\\nNot a bad year for the all-electric sector, when you look at the numbers.\\nThose numbers come in from [Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue\\nBook](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2024-ev-sales/), which\\ndelivered its long-awaited annual U.S. sales report today.\\n\\n![logo](https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/evus_newsletter_widget_logo.svg)\\n\\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your\\ninbox.\\n\\nback\\n\\nSubscribe For more info, read our [Privacy\\nPolicy](https://accounts.motorsportnetwork.com/legal/privacy-policy) & [Terms\\nof Use](https://www.motor1.com/info/terms-of-use/).\\n\\nAs we noted previously, [the fourth quarter of 2024 was an especially strong\\none](https://insideevs.com/news/746165/us-ev-sales-trump-bump-2024/) for\\nelectric sales, driven in part by aggressive end-of-year lease and finance\\ndeals and fears that the new presidential administration could eliminate some\\nor all of the EV tax credits. In the end, electric sales were up 7.3%\\nannually, and that 8% electric market share was also up from 7.8% in 2023. So\\nit was a good year of electric sales for many automakers\\u2014but certainly not all\\nof them, Cox Automotive reports.\\n\\n\\\"The gains in 2024 were also supported by excellent new products, particularly\\nfrom General Motors and Honda Motor Co., which together sold nearly 80,000\\nmore EVs in 2024 than in 2023,\\\" the report said. \\\"Hyundai Motor Group and Ford\\nMotor Company also notably increased EV sales last year.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, \\\"By volume, Tesla sales were estimated to be lower year over year by\\nmore than 37,000 units (roughly the volume GM added). VW and Mercedes-Benz\\nalso posted significantly lower volumes in 2024 compared to 2023,\\\" the report\\nsaid.\\n\\n![Tesla Supercharger Network: Opening Up In North\\nAmerica](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\\n\\nTesla Supercharger Network: Opening Up In North America\\n\\nIndeed, [Tesla has been losing market\\nshare](https://insideevs.com/news/745958/tesla-q4-2024-production-deliveries-\\nsales/) for some time now. Blame increased competition, an aging lineup of\\nvehicles or people being turned off by CEO Elon Musk, or some combination of\\nthose things, but as the EV sector grows the leadership of the company that\\nkicked it all off was bound to shrink sooner or later. Fans [haven't warmed up\\nto the styling](https://insideevs.com/news/715669/2025-eqs-update-mercedes-\\nbenz/) and high costs of Mercedes-Benz's EVs, and Volkswagen took a major hit\\nwith the ID.4 crossover halting sales [for about three\\nmonths](https://insideevs.com/news/746228/vw-id4-stop-sale-ends/).\\n\\nBut even with those tailwinds, Tesla kept its EV sales crown in 2024. Here are\\nCox Automotive's top 10 best-selling electric models in the U.S. last year:\\n\\n  1. Tesla Model Y\\n  2. Tesla Model 3\\n  3. Ford Mustang Mach-E\\n  4. Hyundai Ioniq 5\\n  5. Tesla Cybertruck\\n  6. Ford F-150 Lightning\\n  7. Honda Prologue\\n  8. Chevrolet Equinox\\n  9. Cadillac Lyriq\\n  10. Rivian R1S\\n\\nThere are a few things we can parse from these results, so let's dig in.\\n\\nThe wins from the Model Y and Model 3 aren't terribly surprising, given\\nTesla's still class-leading charging network and the rapid-fire price cuts on\\nthe cars. It's still hard to go wrong with either of them. What's even more\\ninteresting is that the Mustang Mach-E kept its long-held third-place slot;\\nthe Mach-E has received several important updates and new trim levels as of\\nlate, and it remains among the first non-Tesla EVs to be able to use the\\nubiquitous Supercharger network. The Mach-E is also now the top-selling\\nMustang model of any kind.\\n\\n![2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5\\nLimited](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\\n\\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited\\n\\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\\n\\nThe Ioniq 5 had an extremely strong year, leading the charge for Hyundai to\\nbecome the no. 2 U.S. seller of EVs behind Tesla. (Third place went to GM and\\nfourth went to Ford, if you're curious.) With a native Tesla-style NACS plug\\nfrom the factory and U.S. production allowing it to score whatever EV tax\\ncredits survive the Trump administration, it could have an even better year\\nahead.\\n\\nWhile [demand has indeed slowed for the\\nCybertruck](https://insideevs.com/news/747195/tesla-cybertruck-sales-\\ndemand-2024/), it still edged out the F-150 Lightning as America's best-\\nselling electric pickup truck; that's no easy task. Still, the truck remains\\nincredibly polarizing, and the fact that Tesla entered the truck market but\\nstill couldn't eke out a year of sales gains is quite telling.\\n\\nGM clearly had an excellent year of sales, but [the Honda Prologue was the\\nreal surprise there](https://insideevs.com/news/746249/honda-\\nprologue-2024-sales/); as we have written before, it's proof that people want\\ngood EVs from this Japanese brand. (The intense lease and financing deals\\ncertainly helped as well.)\\n\\n![Rivian R1S Software](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\\n\\nRivian R1S\\n\\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\\n\\nFinally, the Rivian R1S keeping its slot in the top 10 was another positive\\nsign for the company, which saw sales rise nearly 4% in 2024 despite a parts\\nissue halting new car production for longer than the automaker surely wanted.\\n\\nBut as CES proved last week with companies all over the world focused on\\nbatteries, software and autonomy, we're likely in for another banner year for\\nthe growth of electrified cars\\u2014and Cox Automotive's analysts agree. \\\"In fact,\\nin the year ahead, one out of every four vehicles sold will likely be\\nelectrified in some way\\u2014a hybrid, plug-in hybrid or pure EV,\\\" the report said.\\n\\\"One thing is for certain: Each year, more electric vehicles with advanced\\nbattery technology are making their way onto America\\u2019s roads.\\\"\\n\\n_Contact the\\nauthor:[patrick.george@insideevs.com](mailto:patrick.george@insideevs.com)_\\n\\nMore EV Sales News\\n\\n[ ![tesla cybertruck sales demand\\n2024](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) The Tesla Cybertruck\\nWas A Hit In 2024, But The Hype Is Fading\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/747195/tesla-cybertruck-sales-demand-2024/)\\n\\n[ ![bmw 2024 us ev sales\\nrecord](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) Nobody\\u2019s Talking\\nAbout BMW\\u2019s U.S. EV Sales Record\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/747173/bmw-2024-us-ev-sales-record/)\\n\\n[ ![sony honda afeela dealers\\nces](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) The Car Dealership\\nModel Is Starting To Crack Like Never Before\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/747005/sony-honda-afeela-dealers-ces/)\\n\\n[ ![plugged in podcast ces\\n2025](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) Honda, Sony And\\nChinese EVs: The Big News From CES 2025\\n](https://insideevs.com/features/746815/plugged-in-podcast-ces-2025/)\\n\\n[ ![mercedes ev sales fall\\n2024](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) Mercedes U.S. EV Sales\\nPlummeted In 2024 While PHEVs Surged\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/746611/mercedes-ev-sales-fall-2024/)\\n\\n[ ![honda prologue 2024\\nsales](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) The Honda Prologue\\nWas The Surprise EV Hit Of 2024 ](https://insideevs.com/news/746249/honda-\\nprologue-2024-sales/)\\n\\nWe want your opinion!\\n\\nWhat would you like to see on Insideevs.com?\\n\\n[ Take our 3 minute survey. ](/survey/2025/)\\n\\n\\\\- The InsideEVs team\\n\\nShare this Story\\n\\n  * [ Facebook  ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ X  ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F&text=These+Are+The+Top-Selling+U.S.+Electric+Vehicles+Of+2024&via=InsideEVs)\\n  * [ LinkedIn  ](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ Flipboard  ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F&title=These+Are+The+Top-Selling+U.S.+Electric+Vehicles+Of+2024&v=2)\\n  * [ Reddit  ](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ WhatsApp  ](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ E-Mail  ](mailto:?body=Hey%2C%20I%20thought%20you%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20see%20this%20article%20on%20InsideEVs.%20Enjoy%21%0A%0AThese%20Are%20The%20Top-Selling%20U.S.%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Of%202024%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F&subject=These%20Are%20The%20Top-Selling%20U.S.%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Of%202024)\\n\\nGO TO COMMENTS\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\nGot a tip for us?

expertise. Starting from Delhi University and PwC, he\\njoined SolarCity and then Tesla. In August 2023, Taneja became Tesla's CFO,\\nand in 2024, he became the highest-paid CFO globally, marking a journey of\\nquiet determination and sharp financial acumen.\\n\\n![Vaibhav Taneja educational qualifications: How this DU graduate became the\\nCFO of Elon Musk-led\\nTesla](https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121332152,imgsize-18306,width-400,resizemode-4/121332152.jpg)\\n\\nIn the world of high-stakes corporate finance, where headlines are often\\ndominated by Wall Street veterans and Silicon Valley prodigies, one name has\\nquietly risen to the top: [Vaibhav\\nTaneja](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vaibhav-taneja).Born in 1977\\nand raised in Delhi, India, Taneja wasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t always in the limelight. He\\ndidn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t come from a famous business family or boast an Ivy League degree. But\\nwhat he did have was an unwavering love for numbers, a methodical mind, and\\nthe kind of discipline that often goes unnoticed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094until it changes\\neverything.Today, Taneja is the Chief Financial Officer of\\n[Tesla](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tesla), one of the most\\nvaluable companies on the planet. In 2024, he became the highest-paid CFO in\\nthe world, earning a jaw-dropping $139.5 million in a single year. But his\\njourney to that role didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t happen overnight\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094it was built over decades of\\nhard work, quiet leadership, and smart choices.\\n\\n## Roots in Delhi: A foundation of discipline\\n\\nTaneja\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s journey began in the classrooms of Delhi University, where he\\nearned his Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) degree in 1999. That same year, he also\\nachieved the prestigious title of [Chartered\\nAccountant](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/chartered-accountant)\\nfrom the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a qualification known\\nfor its rigor and prestige.\\n\\n## The PwC chapter: 17 years of quiet mastery\\n\\nSoon after graduating, Taneja joined PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of the\\nworld\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s largest accounting firms. Over the next 17 years, he immersed\\nhimself in the world of assurance, working across India and the United States.\\nHe eventually rose to the role of Senior Manager, earning the respect of peers\\nand clients alike.For nearly two decades, he sharpened his skills\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094examining\\nbalance sheets, ensuring compliance, and building a reputation for accuracy\\nand integrity. It was during these years that he became a Certified Public\\nAccountant (CPA) in the U.S., further broadening his global credentials.But\\neven after nearly two decades in a stable, respected role, Taneja wasn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t\\ncontent to coast.\\n\\n## Journey from SolarCity to Tesla\\n\\nIn 2016, Taneja made a career move that would change everything\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094he joined\\nSolarCity, a clean energy firm led by [Elon\\nMusk](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/elon-musk)\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s cousins, as\\nCorporate Controller. It was a high-risk move, leaving the comfort of PwC for\\na fast-growing company in a volatile industry.That risk paid off. In early\\n2017, Tesla acquired SolarCity, and Taneja was pulled into the orbit of one of\\nthe world\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s most ambitious companies.\\n\\n## Climbing Tesla\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s ranks and becoming the CFO\\n\\nAt Tesla, Taneja hit the ground running. He was appointed Assistant Corporate\\nController in February 2017, then promoted to Corporate Controller in May\\n2018.By March 2019, he was promoted again\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094this time as Chief Accounting\\nOfficer, replacing Dave Morton. Two years later, he also became Director of\\nTesla India Motors and Energy Pvt. Ltd., Tesla\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Indian subsidiary based in\\nBangalore.In August 2023, Vaibhav Taneja reached the top of the financial\\nladder when he was appointed Chief Financial Officer of Tesla, succeeding Zach\\nKirkhorn. He now oversees the finances of a company that isn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t just making\\ncars\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s reshaping transportation, energy, and technology\\nworldwide.Vaibhav Taneja\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s rise from [Delhi University\\ngraduate](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/delhi-university-graduate)\\nto the [CFO of Tesla](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cfo-of-tesla)\\nis a story of quiet determination and sharp financial acumen. In a world that\\noften celebrates loud ambition, Taneja\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s journey proves that consistency,\\nintegrity, and expertise can speak louder\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and take you farther\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094than words\\never could.\\n\\n  \\n  \\n[**_Invest in Their Tomorrow, Today: Equip your child with the essential AI skills for a future brimming with possibilities | Join Now_**](https://timeslearn.indiatimes.com/ai-masterclass-for-students?ag=TOI_ArticleFt \\\"https://timeslearn.indiatimes.com/ai-masterclass-for-students?ag=TOI_ArticleFt\\\")  \\n\\nEnd of Article\\n\\nFollow Us On Social Media\\n\\n##  Visual Stories\\n\\nPrevious\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __9 best pictures of space\\ncaptured by NASA 's Hubble Space\\nTelescopeLifestyle](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-\\nstyle/spotlight/web-stories/9-best-pictures-of-space-captured-by-nasas-hubble-\\nspace-telescope/photostory/121331920.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __10 types of summer salads\\nto keep the gut healthy Food](https://recipes.timesofindia.com/web-\\nstories/10-types-of-summer-salads-to-keep-the-gut-\\nhealthy/photostory/121333471.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __8 best tips to get rid of\\noily skin this summer Lifestyle](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-\\nstyle/beauty/web-stories/8-best-tips-to-get-rid-of-oily-skin-this-\\nsummer/photostory/118422319.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __Bigg Boss fame Nitibha\\nKaul\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stunning looks from Cannes 2025\\ntv](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/web-stories/hindi/bigg-boss-fame-\\nnitibha-kauls-stunning-looks-from-cannes-2025/photostory/121335020.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __Aishwarya Rai Bachchan 's\\nStunning Evolution at Cannes: A Journey Through the\\nYearsEntertainment](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/web-\\nstories/aishwarya-rai-bachchans-stunning-evolution-at-cannes-a-journey-\\nthrough-the-years/photostory/121334012.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __10 places in Western\\nGhats that are a nature lover 's\\nparadisetravel](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/web-\\nstories/10-places-in-western-ghats-that-are-a-nature-lovers-\\nparadise/photostory/121333221.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __Lakshmi Menon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s stylish\\npictures are pure magic\\nEntertainment](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/web-\\nstories/lakshmi-menons-stylish-pictures-are-pure-\\nmagic/photostory/121207801.cms)\\n\\n[![](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms) __Why should you eat\\nalmonds daily?

He entered the 250-level tournament in China with an 0-4 record in tour-level matches this season, ranked 777\\nth\\nin the world rankings, and without an ATP Tour title since 2021. When the soon-to-be 36-year-old dropped the first set of his first match to Zachary Svajda, another quick exit appeared in the offing.\\nBut from then on, Cilic began to resemble the player of his past: a champion. The Croat also entered this tournament with 20 titles to his name, none more significant than the US Open trophy he won 10 years ago. But age, injuries and form conspired to send the veteran plummeting down the tennis totem pole.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s been a difficult period for me, in these last 20 months,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Cilic. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099ve lost my ranking, I didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t play too much.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\\nOvercoming all the obstacles \\u00f0\\u009f\\u00a5\\u00b9\\u00f0\\u009f\\u0091\\u008f\\n@cilic_marin\\nspeaks after winning Hangzhou.\\n#HangzhouOpen\\npic.twitter.com/7bvG2CQnMJ\\n\\u2014 Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel)\\nSeptember 24, 2024\\nAdvertising\\nHe received a wild card into Hangzhou\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and repaid the organizers by going all the way.\\nWhile those organizers and the fans would have likely preferred to see Chinese star Zhang Zhizhen prevail, no one could hold back a smile after seeing Cilic once again swing his racquet with success. After dropping that aforementioned set, he dropped just one more in total, capping his stay with a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5) win.\\nThe smile on his face after match point, and while accepting his championship, said it all.\\nWorld No. 777 \\u00e2\\u009e\\u00a1\\u00ef\\u00b8\\u008f Hangzhou Champion \\u00f0\\u009f\\u008f\\u0086\\nWildcard Marin Cilic defeats Zhang Zhizhen to win his first title since 2021.\\n#HangzhouOpen\\npic.twitter.com/gLTtui1lsR\\n\\u2014 Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel)\\nSeptember 24, 2024\\nAdvertising\\nMonday\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s ATP rankings incorporated Cilic\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s victories over Svadja, Yoshihito Nishioka and Yasutaka Uchiyama in Hangzhou, which boosted Cilic\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s rank to No. 373.
